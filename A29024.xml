            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>A PRAEFACE INTRODUCTORY <hi>To the following Treatiſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give the Reader an account, Why the following Treatiſe is ſuffer'd to paſs abroad ſo maim'd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, I muſt inform him that 'tis now long ſince, that to gratify an ingenious Gentleman, I ſet down ſome of the Reaſons that kept me from fully acquieſcing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Peripatetical, or in the Chymical Doctrine, of the Material Principles of mixt Bodies. This Diſcourſe ſome years after falling into the hands of ſome Learned men, had the good luck to be ſo favourably receiv'd, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly ſpoken of by them, that having had more then ordinary Invitations given me to make it publick, I thought fit to review it, that I might retrench ſome things that ſeem'd not ſo fit to be ſhewn to every Reader, And ſubſtitute ſome of thoſe other things that occurr'd to me of
<pb facs="tcp:105458:3"/>the tryals and obſervations I had ſince made. What became of my papers, I elſewhere mention in a Preface where I complain of it: But ſince I writ That, I found many ſheets that belong'd to the ſubjects I am now about to diſcourſe of. Wherefore ſeeing that I had then in my hands as much of the first Dialogue as was requiſite to state the Caſe, and ſerve for an Introduction as well to the conference betwixt <hi>Carneades</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi> as to ſome other Dialogues, which for certain reaſons are not now herewith publiſh'd, I reſolv'd to ſupply, as well as I could, the Contents of a Paper belonging to the ſecond of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes, which I could not poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, though it were the chief of them all. And having once more try'd the Opinion of Friends, but not of the ſame, about this imperfect work, I found it ſuch, that I was content in complyance with their Deſires, that not only it ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, but that it ſhould be publiſh'd as ſoon as conveniently might be. I had indeed all along the Dialogues ſpoken of my ſelf, as of a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; For, they containing Diſcourſes which were among the firſt Treatiſes that I ventur'd long ago to write of matters Philoſophical, I had reaſon to deſire, with the Painter, to <hi>latere pone tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> and hear what men would ſay of them, before I own'd my ſelf to be their Author. But beſides that now I find, 'tis not unknown to many who it is
<pb facs="tcp:105458:3"/>that writ them, I am made to believe that 'tis not inexpedient, they ſhould be known to come from a Perſon not altogether a ſtranger to Chymical Affairs. And I made the leſſe ſcruple to let them come abroad uncompleated, partly, becauſe my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Prae-ingagements to publiſh divers other Treatiſes allow'd me ſmall hopes of being able in a great while to compleat theſe Dialogues. And partly, becauſe I am not unapt to think, that they may come abroad ſeaſonably enough, though not for the Authors reputation, yet for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſes. For I obſerve, that of late Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry begins, as indeed it deſerves, to be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by Learned Men who before deſpis'd it; and to be pretended to by many who never culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated it, that they may be thought not to ignore it: Whence it is come to paſſe, that divers Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Notions about Matters Philoſophical are taken for granted and employ'd, and ſo adopted by very eminent Writers both Naturaliſts and Phyſitians. Now this I fear may prove ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prejudicial to the Advancement of ſolid Philoſophy: For though I am a great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem of divers Chymical Remedies, yet I diſtinguiſh theſe from their Notions about the cauſes of things, and their manner of Generation. And for ought I can hitherto diſcern, there are a thouſand <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, beſides a
<pb facs="tcp:105458:4"/>Multitude of Accidents relating to the humane Body, which will ſcarcely be clearly &amp; ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily made out by them that confine themſelves to deduce things from Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymists, without taking much more Notice than they are wont to do, of the Motions and Figures, of the ſmall Parts of Matter, and the other more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Fruitful affections of Bodies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not perhaps be now unſeaſonable to let our <hi>Carneades</hi> warne Men, not to ſubſcribe to the grand Doctrine of the Chymiſts touching their three Hypoſtatical Principles, till they have a little examin'd it, and conſider'd, how they can clear it from his Objections, divers of which 'tis like they may never have thought on; ſince a Chymiſt ſcarce would, and none but a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt could propoſe them. I hope alſo it will not be unacceptable to ſeveral Ingenious Perſons, who are unwilling to determine of any important Controverſie, without a previous conſideration of what may be ſaid on both ſides, and yet have greater deſires to underſtand Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to find here together, beſides ſeveral Experiments of my own purpoſely made to Illuſtrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others ſcarce to be met with, otherwiſe then Scatter'd among many Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Books. And to Find theſe Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
<pb facs="tcp:105458:4"/>Experiments ſo Deliver'd as that an Ordinary Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the uſuall Chymical Termes, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily enough Understand Them; and even a wary One may ſafely rely on Them. Theſe Things I add, becauſe a Perſon any Thing vers'd in the Writings of Chymists cannot but Diſcern by their obſcure, ambiguous, and almost Aenigmatical Way of expreſſing what they pretend to Teach, that they have no Mind to be underſtood at all, but by <hi>the Sons of Art</hi> (as they call them) nor to be Underſtood even by theſe without Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls. Inſomuch that ſome of Them Scarce ever ſpeak ſo candidly, as when they make uſe of that known Chymical Sentence; <hi>Ubi palam locuti ſumus, ibi nihil diximus.</hi> And as the obſcurity of what ſome Writers deliver makes it very difficult to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; ſo the Unfaithfulneſs of too many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers makes it unfit to be reli'd on. For though unwillingly, Yet I must for the truths ſake, and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical Experiments when they are ſet down only by way of Preſcriptions, and not of Relations; that is, unleſs he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular knowledge, or upon the Relation of ſome credible perſon, avowing it upon his own experience. For I
<pb facs="tcp:105458:5"/>am troubled, I muſt complain, that even Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Writers, both Phyſitians and Philoſophers, whom I can eaſily name, if it be requir'd, have of late ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſo far impos'd upon, as to Publiſh and Build upon Chymical Experiments, which queſtionleſs they never try'd; for if they had, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be true. And indeed it were to be wiſh'd, that now that thoſe begin to quote Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Experiments that are not themſelves Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indefinite Way of Vouching the Chymists ſay this, or the Chymiſts affirme that, and would rather for each Experiment they alledge name the Author or Authors, upon whoſe credit they relate it; For, by this means they would ſecure themſelves from the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſhood (to which the other Practice Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them) and they would Leave the Reader to Judge of what is fit for him to Believe of what is Deliver'd, whilſt they employ not their own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations; and they will alſo do Juſtice to the Inventors or Publiſhers of true Experiments, as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Obtruders of falſe ones. Whereas by that general Way of quoting the Chymiſts, the candid Writer is Defrauded of the particular Praiſe, and the Impoſtor eſcapes the Perſonal Diſgrace that is due to him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105458:5"/>
                  <p>The remaining Part of this Praeface muſt be imploy'd in ſaying ſomething for <hi>Carneades,</hi> and ſomething for my Self.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Carneades</hi> hopes that he will be thought to have diſputed civilly and Modeſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for one that was to play the Antagoniſt and the Sceptick. And if he any where ſeem to ſleight his Adverſaries Tenents and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he is willing to have it look'd upon as what he was induc'd to, not ſo much by his Opinion of them, as the Examples of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> and <hi>Philoponus,</hi> and the cuſtom of ſuch kind of Diſputes.</p>
                  <p>Next, In caſe that ſome of his Arguments ſhall not be thought of the moſt Cogent ſort that may be, he hopes it will be conſider'd that it ought not to be Expected, that they ſhould be So. For, his Part being chiefly but to propoſe Doubts and Scruples, he does enough, if he ſhews that his Adverſaries Arguments are not ſtrongly Concluding, though his own be not ſo neither. And if there ſhould appear any diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the things he delivers in divers paſſages, he hopes it will be conſider'd, that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all the things a Sceptick Propoſes, ſhould be conſonant; ſince it being his work to Suggeſt doubts againſt the Opinion he queſtions, it is allowable for him to propoſe two or more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> about the ſame thing: And to
<pb facs="tcp:105458:6"/>ſay that it may be accounted for this way, or that way, or the other Way, though theſe wayes be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps inconſiſtent among Themſelves. Becauſe it is enough for him, if either of the propoſed <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes</hi> be but as probable as that he calls a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And if he propoſes many that are Each of them probable, he does the more ſatisfie his doubts, by making it appear the more difficult to be ſure, that that which they alwayes differ from is the true. And our <hi>Garneades</hi> by holding the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he has this Advantage, that if among all the Instances he brings to invalidate all the Vulgar Doctrine of thoſe he Diſputes with, any one be Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable, that alone is ſufficient to overthrow a Doctrine which Univerſally aſſerts what he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. For, it cannot be true, that all Bodies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that are reckon'd among the Perfectly mixt Ones, are Compounded of ſuch a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Number of ſuch or ſuch Ingredients, in caſe any one ſuch Body can be produc'd, that is not ſo compounded; and he hopes too, that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateneſs will be the leſs expected from him, becauſe his undertaking obliges him to maintain ſuch Opinions in Chymiſtry, and that chiefly by Chymical Arguments, as are Contrary to the very Principles of the Chymiſts; From whoſe writings it is not Therefore like he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any intentionall Aſſistance, except from ſome Paſſages of the Bold and Ingenious <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:105458:6"/>with whom he yet diſagrees in many things (which reduce him to explicate Divers Chymical <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> according to other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;) And of whoſe Ratiocinations, not only ſome ſeem very Extravagant, but even the Rest are not wont to be as conſiderable as his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And though it be True indeed, that ſome <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> have occaſionally written againſt the Chymical Doctrine he Oppugnes, yet ſince they have done it according to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, And ſince our <hi>Carneades</hi> muſt as well op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> as that of the Spagyrist, he was fain to fight his Adverſaries with their own Weapons, Thoſe of the Peripatetick being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, if not hurtfull for a Perſon of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; beſides that thoſe <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> (at Leaſt, thoſe he met with,) that have written against the Chymiſts, ſeem to have had ſo little Experimental Knowledge in Chymical Matters, that by their frequent Miſtakes and unskilfull Way of Oppugning, they have too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expos'd Themſelves to the Deriſion of their Adverſaries, for writing ſo Confidently against what they appear ſo little to underſtand.</p>
                  <p>And Lastly, <hi>Carneades</hi> hopes, he ſhall doe the Ingenious this Piece of ſervice, that by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thus drawn the Chymists Doctrine out of their Dark and Smoakie Laboratories, and both brought it into the open light, and ſhewn the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:105458:7"/>of their Proofs, that have hitherto been wont to be brought for it, either Judicious Men ſhall henceforth be allowed calmly and after due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to diſbelieve it, or thoſe abler Chymiſts, that are zealous for the reputation of it, will be oblig'd to ſpeak plainer then hitherto has been done, and maintain it by better Experiments and Arguments then Thoſe <hi>Carneades</hi> hath examin'd: ſo That he hopes, the Curious will one Way or other Derive either ſatisfaction or instruction from his endeavours. And as he is ready to make good the profeſſion he makes in the cloſe of his Diſcourſe, he being ready to be better inform'd, ſo he expects either to be indeed inform'd, or to be let alone. For Though if any Truly knowing Chymiſts ſhall Think fit in a civil and rational way to ſhew him any truth touching the matter in Diſpute That he yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not, <hi>Carneades</hi> will not refuſe either to admit, or to own a Conviction: yet if any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Perſon ſhall, either to get Himſelf a Name, or for what other end ſoever, wilfully or careleſly miſtake the State of the Controverſie,
<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:105458:7"/>Deliver'd, <hi>Carneades</hi> profeſſes, That he values his time ſo much, as not to think the anſwering ſuch Trifles worth the loſs of it.</p>
                  <p>And now having ſaid thus much for <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> I hope the Reader will give me leave to ſay ſomething too for my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And first, if ſome moroſe Readers ſhall find fault with my having made the Interlocutors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion complement with one another, and that I have almost all along written theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues in a ſtile more Faſhionable then That of meer ſcholars is wont to be, I hope I ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd by them that ſhall conſider, that to keep a due <hi>decorum</hi> in the Diſcourſes, it was fit that in a book written by a Gentleman, and wherein only Gentlemen are introduc'd as ſpeakers, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſhould be more ſmooth, and the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more civil than is uſual in the more Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick way of writing. And indeed, I am not ſorry to have this Opportunity of giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample how to manage even Diſputes with Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; whence perhaps ſome Readers will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to diſcern a Difference betwixt Bluntneſs of ſpeech and Strength of reaſon, and find that a man may be a Champion for Truth, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Enemy to Civility; and may confute an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion without railing at Them that hold it; To whom he that deſires to convince and not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, muſt make ſome amends by his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
<pb facs="tcp:105458:8"/>to their Perſons, for his ſeverity to their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; and muſt ſay as little elſe as he can, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them, when he ſays that they are in an error.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps other Readers will be leſs apt to find fault with the Civility of my Diſputants, than the Chymiſts will be, upon the reading of ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the following Dialogue, to accuſe <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> of Aſperity. But if I have made my Sceptick ſometimes ſpeak ſleightingly of the Opinions he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I hope it will not be found that I have done any more, than became the Part he was to act of an Opponent: Eſpecially, if what I have made him ſay be compar'd with what the Prince of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Orators himſelf makes both great Perſons and Friends ſay of one anothers Opinions, in his excellent Dialogues, <hi>De Natura Deorum:</hi> And I ſhall ſcarce be ſuſpected of Partiality, in the caſe, by them that take Notice that there is full as much (if not far more) liberty of ſleighting their Adverſaries Tenents to be met with in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of thoſe with whom <hi>Carneades</hi> diſputes. Nor needed I make the Interlocutors ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then freely in a Dialogue, wherein it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intimated, that I meant not to declare my own Opinion of the Arguments propos'd, much leſſe of the whole Controverſy it ſelf otherwiſe than as it may by an attentive Reader be gueſs'd at by ſome Paſſages of <hi>Carneades:</hi> (I ſay, ſome Paſſages, becauſe I make not all that he ſays, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the heat of Diſputation, mine,) partly in this Diſcourſe, and partly in ſome other Dialogues betwixt the ſame ſpeakers (though they treat not immediately of the Elements) which have long
<pb facs="tcp:105458:8"/>layn by me, and expect the Entertainment that theſe preſent Diſcourſes will meet with. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they will much miſtake me, that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from what I now publiſh, that I am at Defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Chymiſtry, or would make my Readers ſo. I hope the <hi>Specimina</hi> I have lately publiſh'd of an attempt to ſhew the uſefulneſs of Chymical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to Contemplative Philoſophers, will give thoſe that ſhall read them other thoughts of me; &amp; I had a deſign (but wanted opportunity) to publiſh with theſe Papers an Eſſay I have lying by me, the greater part of which is Apologetical for one ſort of Chymiſts. And at leaſt, as for thoſe that know me, I hope the pain I have taken in the fire will both convince them, that I am far from being an Enemy to the Chymiſts Art, (though I am no friend to many that diſgrace it by profeſſing it,) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to believe me when I declare that I diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe Chymiſts that are either Cheats, or but Laborants, and the true <hi>Adepti;</hi> By whom, could I enjoy their Converſation, I would both willingly and thankfully be inſtructed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning the Nature and Generation of Metals: And poſſibly, thoſe that know how little I have remitted of my former addictedneſs to make Chymical Experiments, will eaſily believe, that one of the chief Deſignes of this Sceptical Diſcourſe was, not ſo much to diſcredit Chymiſtry, as to give an occaſion and a kind of neceſſity to the more knowing Artiſts to lay aſide a little of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great Reſervedneſs, &amp; either explicate or prove the Chymical Theory better than ordinary Chymiſts have done, or by enriching us with ſome of their nobler ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb facs="tcp:105458:9"/>to evince that Their art is able to make amends even for the deficiencies of their Theory: And thus much I ſhall here make bold to add, that we ſhall much undervalue Chymiſtry, if we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it cannot teach us things farr more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not only to Phyſick but to Philoſophy, than thoſe that are hitherto known to vulgar Chymiſts. And yet as for inferiour Spagyriſts themſelves, they have by their labours deſerv'd ſo well of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning, that methinks 'tis Pity they ſhould ever miſſe the Truth which they have ſo induſtriouſly ſought. And though I be no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the Theorical Part of their Art, yet my conjectures will much deceive me, if the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Part be not much more cultivated than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it has been, and do not both employ Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Philoſophers, and help to make men ſuch. Nor would I that have been diverted by other Studies as well as affairs, be thought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend being a profound Spagyrist, by finding ſo many faults in the Doctrine wherein the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chymiſts ſcruples not to Acquieſce: For beſides that 'tis moſt commonly far eaſier to frame Objections against any propos'd <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> than to propoſe an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> not lyable to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections (beſides this I ſay) 'tis no ſuch great matter, if whereas Beginners in Chymiſtry are commonly at once imbu'd with the Theory and Operations of their profeſſion, I who had the
<pb facs="tcp:105458:9"/>good Fortune to Learn the Operations from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Perſons, upon whoſe credit I was not Tempted to take up any opinion about them, ſhould conſider things with leſſe prejudice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently with other Eyes than the Generality of Learners; And ſhould be more diſpos'd to accommodate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that occur'd to me to other Notions than to thoſe of the Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts. And having at first entertain'd a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition That the Vulgar Principles were leſſe General and comprehenſive, or leſſe conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deduc'd from Chymical Operations, than was believ'd; it was not uneaſie for me both to Take notice of divers <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd by prepoſſest Perſons, that ſeem'd not to ſuite ſo well with the <hi>Hermetical</hi> Doctrine; and to deviſe ſome Experiments likely to furniſh me with Objections against it, not known to many, that having practis'd Chymiſtry longer perchance then I have yet liv'd, may have far more Experience, Than I, of particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, whether the Notions I have propos'd, and the Experiments I have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, be conſiderable, or not, I willingly leave others to Judge; and This only I ſhall ſay for my Self, That I have endeavour'd to deliver matters of Fact, ſo faithfully, that I may as well aſſiſt the leſſe skilful Readers to examine the
<pb facs="tcp:105458:10"/>Chymical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as provoke the Spagyrical Philoſophers to illuſtrate it: which if they do, and that either the Chymical opinion, or the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick, or any other Theory of the Elements differing from that I am moſt inclin'd to, ſhall be intelligibly explicated, and duly prov'd to me; what I have hitherto diſcours'd will not hinder it from making a Proſelyte of a Perſon that Loves Fluctuation of Judgment little enough to be willing to be eas'd of it by any thing but Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Perceive that divers of my Friends have thought it very ſtrange to hear me ſpeak ſo irreſolvedly, as I have been wont to do, concerning thoſe things which ſome take to be the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and others to be the Principles of all mixt Bodies. But I bluſh not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I much leſſe ſcruple to confeſs that I Doubt, when I do ſo, then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105458:11"/>to profeſs that I Know what I do not: And I ſhould have much ſtronger Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations then I dare yet entertain, to ſee Philoſophy ſolidly eſtabliſh't, if men would more carefully diſtinguiſh thoſe things that they know, from thoſe that they ignore or do but think, and then explicate clearly the things they conceive they underſtand, acknowledge ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly what it is they ignore, and profeſs ſo candidly their Doubts, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of intelligent perſons might be ſet on work to make further enquiries, and the eaſineſs of leſs diſcerning Men might not be impos'd on. But becauſe a more particular accompt will probably be expected of my unſatisfyedneſs not only with the Peripatetick, but with the Chymical Doctrine of the Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Bodies: It may poſſibly ſerve to ſatisfy others of the excuſableneſs of my diſatisfaction to peruſe the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation of what paſſed a while ſince at a meeting of perſons of ſeveral opinions, in a place that need not here be named; where the ſubject whereof we have been ſpeaking, was amply and variouſly diſcours'd of.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105458:11"/>
                  <p>It was on one of the faireſt dayes of this Summer that the inquiſitive <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> came to invite me to make a viſit with him to his friend <hi>Carneades.</hi> I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented to this motion, telling him that if he would but permit me to go firſt and make an excuſe at a place not far off, where I had at that hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet, but not about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either of moment, or that could not well admit of a delay, I would preſently wait on him, becauſe of my knowing <hi>Carneades</hi> to be ſo converſant with nature and with Furnaces, and ſo unconfin'd to vulgar Opinions, that he would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by ſome ingenious Paradox or other, give our mindes at leaſt a pleaſing Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and perhaps enrich them with ſome ſolid inſtruction. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> then firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me to the place where my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology was to be made, I accompanied him to the lodging of <hi>Carneades,</hi> where when we were come, we were told by the Servants, that he was retired with a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Friends (whoſe names they alſo told us) to one of the Arbours in his Garden, to enjoy under its coole ſhades a delightful protection from the yet troubleſome heat of the Sun.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105458:12"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleutherius</hi> being perfectly acquainted with that Garden immediately led me to the Arbour, and relying on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate familiarity that had been long cheriſh'd betwixt him and <hi>Carneades;</hi> in ſpight of my Reluctancy to what might look like an intruſion upon his privacy, drawing me by the hand, he abruptly entered the Arbour, where we found <hi>Carneades, Philoponus,</hi> and <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cloſe about a little round Table, on which beſides paper, pen, and inke, there lay two or three open Books; <hi>Carneades</hi> appeared not at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this ſurpriſe, but riſing from the Table, received his Friend with open looks and armes, and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me alſo with his wonted freedom and civility, invited us to reſt our ſelves by him, which, as ſoon as we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with his two Friends (who were ours alſo) the civilities accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch occaſions, we did. And he preſently after we had ſeated our ſelves, ſhutting the Books that lay open, and turning to us with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſeemed ready to begin ſome ſuch unconcerning diſcourſe as is wont to paſs or rather waſte the time in promiſcuous companies.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105458:12"/>
                  <p>But <hi>Eleutherius</hi> gueſſing at what he meant to do, prevented him by telling him, I perceive <hi>Carneades</hi> by the books that you have been now ſhutting, and much more by the poſture wherein I found Perſons qualifi'd to diſcourſe of ſerious matters, and ſo accuſtom'd to do it, that you three were before our coming, engag'd in ſome Philoſophical conference, which I hope you will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecute, and allow us to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, in recompence of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we have us'd in preſuming to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you, or elſe give us leave to repair the injury we ſhould otherwiſe do you, by leaving you to the freedom we have interrupted, and puniſhing our ſelves for our boldneſs by depriving our ſelves of the happineſs of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. With theſe laſt words he and I roſe up, as if we meant to be gone, But <hi>Carneades</hi> ſuddenly laying hold on his arme, and ſtopping him by it, ſmile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly told him, We are not ſo forward to loſe good company as you ſeem to imagine; eſpecially ſince you are pleas'd to deſire to be preſent at what we ſhall ſay, about ſuch a Subject as that You found us conſidering. For that, being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105458:13"/>the number of the Elements, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or Materiall Ingredients of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is an enquiry whoſe truth is of that Importance, and of that Difficulty, that it may as well deſerve as require to be ſearched into by ſuch skilfull Indaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Nature as your ſelves. And therefore we ſent to invite the bold and acute <hi>Leucippus</hi> to lend us ſome light by his Atomical Paradox, upon which we expected ſuch pregnant hints, that 'twas not without a great deal of trouble that we had lately word brought us that he was not to be found; and we had likewiſe begg'd the Aſſiſtance of your preſence and thoughts, had not the meſſenger we employ'd to <hi>Leucippus</hi> inform'd us, that as he was going, he ſaw you both paſs by towards another part of the Town; And this fruſtrated expectation of <hi>Leucippus</hi> his company, who told me but laſt night that he would be ready to give me a meeting where I pleas'd to day, having very long ſuſpended our conference about the freſhly mention'd Subject, it was ſo newly begun when you came in, that we ſhall ſcarce need to repeat any thing to acquaint you with what has paſs'd betwixt us before
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105458:13"/>your arrival, ſo that I cannot but look upon it as a fortunate Accident that you ſhould come ſo ſeaſonably, to be not hearers alone, but we hope Interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at our conference. For we ſhall not only allow of your preſence at it, but deſire your Aſſiſtance in it; which I adde both for other reaſons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though theſe learned Gentlemen (ſayes he, turning to his two friends) need not fear to diſcourſe before any Auditory, provided it be intelligent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to underſtand them, yet for my part (continues he with a new ſmile,) I ſhall not dare to vent my unpremedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoughts before two ſuch Criticks, unleſs by promiſing to take your turnes of ſpeaking, You will allow me mine of quarrelling, with what has been ſaid. He and his friends added divers things to convince us that they were both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that we ſhould hear them, and reſolved againſt our doing ſo, unleſs we allowed them ſometimes to hear us. <hi>Elutherius</hi> after having a while fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly endeavoured to obtain leave to be ſilent promis'd he would not be ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, provided that he were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the freedom of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105458:14"/>Genious and Principles to ſide with one of them in the managing of one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and, if he ſaw cauſe, with his Antagoniſt, in the Proſecution of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without being confin'd to ſtick to any one party or Opinion, which was after ſome debate accorded him. But I conſcious to my own Diſability's told them reſolutely that <hi>I</hi> was as much more willing as more fit to be a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a ſpeaker, among ſuch knowing Perſons, and on ſo abſtruſe a Subject. And that therefore I beſeeched them without neceſſitating me to proclaim my weakneſſes, to allow me to leſſen them by being a ſilent Auditor of their Diſcourſes: to ſuffer me to be at which I could preſent them no motive, ſave that their inſtructions would make them in me a more intelligent Admirer. I added, that I deſir'd not to be idle whilſt they were imploy'd, but would if they pleas'd, by writing down in ſhort hand what ſhould be delivered, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Diſcourſes that I knew would merit to be laſting. At firſt <hi>Carneades</hi> and his two friends utterly rejected this motion; and all that my Reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make uſe of my ears, not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105458:14"/>tongue, at their debates, could do, was to make them acquieſce in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who thinking himſelf concern'd, becauſe he brought me thither, to afford me ſome faint aſſiſtance, was content that I ſhould regiſter their Arguments, that I might be the better able after the concluſion of their conference to give them my ſence upon the Subject of it, (The number of Elements or Principles:) which he promis'd I ſhould do at the end of the preſent Debates, if time would permit, or elſe at our next meeting. And this being by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in my name, though without my conſent, the company would by no means receive my Proteſtation againſt it, but caſting, all at once, their eyes on <hi>Carneades,</hi> they did by that and their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſilence, invite him to begin; which (after a ſhort pauſe, during which he turn'd himſelf to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and me) he did in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the ſubtile reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings I have met with in the books of the Peripateticks, and the pretty expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments that have been ſhew'd me in the Laboratories of Chymiſts, I am of ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105458:15"/>diffident, or dull a Nature, as to think that if neither of them can bring more cogent arguments to evince the truth of their aſſertion then are wont to be brought; a Man may rationally enough retain ſome doubts concerning the very number of thoſe materiall Ingredients of mixt bodies, which ſome would have us call Elements, and others principles. Indeed when I conſidered that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents concerning the Elements are as conſiderable amongſt the Doctrines of natural Philoſophy as the Elements themſelves are among the bodies of the Univerſe, I expected to find thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions ſolidly eſtabliſh'd, upon which ſo many others are ſuperſtructed. But when I took the pains impartially to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the bodies themſelves that are ſaid to reſult from the blended Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to torture them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their conſtituent Principles, I was quickly induc'd to think that the number of the Elements has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about by Philoſophers with more earneſtneſs then ſucceſs. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfiedneſs of mine has been much wonder'd at, by theſe two Gentlemen (at which words he pointed at <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105458:15"/>and <hi>Philoponus</hi>) who though they differ almoſt as much betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the queſtion we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as I do from either of them, yet they both agree very well in this, that there is a determinate number of ſuch ingredients as I was juſt now ſpeaking of, and that what that number is, I ſay not, may be (for what may not ſuch as they perſwade?) but is wont to be clearly enough demonſtrated both by Reaſon and Experience. This has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd our preſent Conference. For our Diſcourſe this afternoon, having fallen from one ſubject to another, and at length ſetl'd on this, they proffer'd to demonſtrate to me, each of them the truth of his opinion, out of both the Topicks that I have freſhly nam'd. But on the former (that of Reaſon ſtrictly ſo taken) we declin'd inſiſting at the preſent, leſt we ſhould not have time enough before ſupper to go thorough the Reaſons and Experiments too. The latter of which we unanimouſly thought the moſt requiſite to be ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd. I muſt deſire you then to take notice Gentlemen (continued <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>) that my preſent buſineſs doth not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105458:16"/>oblige me ſo to declare my own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Subject in queſtion, as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert or deny the truth either of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick, or the Chymical Doctrine concerning the number of the Elements, but only to ſhew you that neither of theſe Doctrines hath been ſatisfactorily proved by the arguments commonly alledged on its behalfe. So that if I really diſcern (as perhaps I think I do) that there may be a more rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then ordinary, given of one of theſe opinions, I am left free to declare my ſelf of it, notwithſtanding my preſent engagement, it being obvious to all your obſervation, that a ſolid truth may be generally maintained by no other, then incompetent Arguments. And to this Declaration I hope it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to add, that my task obliges me not to anſwer the Arguments that may be drawn either for <hi>Themiſtius</hi> or <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s Opinion from the Topick of reaſon, as oppoſed to experiments; ſince 'tis theſe only that I am to examine and not all theſe neither, but ſuch of them alone as either of them ſhall think fit to inſiſt on, and as have hitherto been wont to be brought either to prove that 'tis
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105458:16"/>the four Peripatetick Elements, or that 'tis the three Chymical Principles that all compounded bodies conſiſt of. Theſe things (adds <hi>Carneades</hi>) I thought my ſelf obliged to premiſe, partly leſt you ſhould do theſe Gentlemen (pointing at <hi>Themistius</hi> and <hi>Philoponus,</hi> and ſmiling on them) the injury of meaſuring their parts by the arguments they are ready to propoſe, the lawes of our Conference confining them to make uſe of thoſe that the vulgar of Philoſophers (for even of them there is a vulgar) has drawn up to their hands; and partly, that you ſhould not condemn me of preſumption for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting againſt perſons over whom I can hope for no advantage, that <hi>I</hi> muſt not derive from the nature, or rules of our controverſy, wherein I have but a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to defend, and wherein too I am like on ſeveral occaſions to have the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of one of my diſagreeing adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries againſt the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philoponus</hi> and <hi>Themiſtius</hi> ſoon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this complement with civilities of the like nature, in which <hi>Eleutherius</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them engaged, to prevent the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſs of that time of which they were not like to have very much to ſpare, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105458:17"/>minded them that their preſent buſineſſe was not to exchange complements, but Arguments: and then addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Carneades,</hi> I eſteem it no ſmall happineſſe (ſaies he) that I am come here ſo luckily this Evening. For I have been long disquieted with Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this very ſubject which you are now ready to debate. And ſince a Queſtion of this importance is to be now diſcuſſed by perſons that maintain ſuch variety of opinions concerning it, and are both ſo able to enquire after truth, and ſo ready to embrace it by whomſoever and on what occaſion ſoever it is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; I cannot but promiſe my ſelf that I ſhall before we part either loſe my Doubts or the hopes of ever finding them reſolved: <hi>Eleutherius</hi> pauſed not here; but to prevent their anſwer, added almoſt in the ſame breath; and I am not a little pleaſed to find that you are reſolved on this occaſion to inſiſt rather on Experiments then Syllogiſmes. For I, and no doubt You, have long obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thoſe Dialectical ſubtleties, that the Schoolmen too often employ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Phyſiological Myſteries, are wont much more to declare the wit of him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105458:17"/>that uſes them, then increaſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or remove the doubts of ſober lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of truth. And ſuch captious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties do indeed often puzzle and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſilence men, but rarely ſatisfy them. Being like the tricks of Jugglers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men doubt not but they are cheated, though oftentimes they cannot declare by what ſlights they are impoſed on. And therefore I think you have done very wiſely to make it your buſineſſe to conſider the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> relating to the preſent Queſtion, which have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by experiments, eſpecially ſince it might ſeem injurious to our ſenſes, by whoſe mediation we acquire ſo much of the knowledge we have of things corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to have recourſe to far-fetched and abſtracted Ratiocination, to know what are the ſenſible ingredients of thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things that we daily ſee and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and are ſuppoſed to have the liberty to untwiſt (if I may ſo ſpeak) into the primitive bodies they conſiſt of. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed that he wiſhed therefore they would no longer delay his expected ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if they had not, as he feared they had, forgotten ſomething prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to their debate; and that was to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105458:18"/>lay down what ſhould be all along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the word Principle or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Carneades</hi> thank'd him for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but told him that they had not been unmindful of ſo requiſite a thing. But that being Gentlemen and very far from the litigious humour of loving to wrangle about words or terms or notions as empty; they had before his coming in, readily agreed promiſcuouſly to uſe when they pleaſed, Elements and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as terms equivalent: and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both by the one and the other, thoſe primitive and ſimple Bodies of which the mixt ones are ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and into which they are ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved. And upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (he added) we agreed to diſcourſe of the opinions to be debated, as we have found them maintained by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the aſſertors of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the one party, and of thoſe that receive the three Principles on the other, without tying our ſelves to enquire ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly what notion either <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> or this or that Interpreter, or follower of either of thoſe great perſons, framed of Elements or Principles; our deſign being to examine, not what theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105458:18"/>or thoſe writers thought or taught, but what we find to be the obvious and moſt general opinion of thoſe, who are willing to be accounted Favourers of the Peripatetick or Chymical Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I ſee not (ſaies <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) why you might not immediately begin to argue, if you were but agreed which of your two friendly Adverſaries ſhall be firſt heard. And it being quickly reſolv'd on that <hi>Themistius</hi> ſhould firſt propoſe the Proofs for his Opinion, becauſe it was the antienter, and the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he made not the company ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect long before he thus addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> as to the Perſon leaſt intereſſed in the diſpute.</p>
                  <p>If you have taken ſufficient notice of the late Confeſſion which was made by <hi>Carneades,</hi> and which (though his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity dreſſed it up in complementall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) was exacted of him by his Juſtice, I ſuppoſe You will be eaſily made ſenſible, that I engage in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with great and peculiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, beſides thoſe which his Parts and my Perſonal Diſabilities would bring to any other cauſe to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105458:19"/>maintained by me againſt him. For he juſtly apprehending the force of truth, though ſpeaking by no better a tongue then mine, has made it the chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Duell, that I ſhould lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the beſt Weapons I have, and thoſe I can beſt handle; Whereas if I were allowed the freedom, in pleading for the four Elements, to employ the Arguments ſuggeſted to me by Reaſon to demonſtrare them, I ſhould almoſt as little doubt of making You a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte to thoſe unſever'd Teachers, Truth and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as I do of your Candour and your Judgment. And I hope you will however conſider, that that great Favorite and Interpreter of Nature, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who was (as his <hi>Organum</hi> witneſſes) the greateſt Maſter of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick that ever liv'd, diſclaim'd the courſe taken by other petty Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (Antient and Modern) who not attending the Coherence and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their Opinions, are more ſollicitous to make each particular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion plauſible independently upon the the reſt, then to frame them all ſo, as not only to be conſiſtent together, but to ſupport each other. For that great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105458:19"/>Man in his vaſt and comprehenſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, ſo fram'd each of his Notions, that being curiouſly adapted into one Syſteme, they need not each of them any other defence then that which their mutuall Coherence gives them: As 'tis in an Arch, where each ſingle ſtone, which if ſever'd from the reſt would be perhaps defenceleſs, is ſufficiently ſecur'd by the ſolidity and entireneſs of the whole Fabrick of which it is a part. How juſtly this may be apply'd to the preſent caſe, I could eaſily ſhew You, if I were permitted to declare to You, how harmonious <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Elements is with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles of Philoſophy; and how rationally he has deduc'd their number from that of the combinations of the four firſt Qualities from the kinds of ſimple Motion belonging to ſimple bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and from I know not how many other Principles and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, which ſo conſpire with his Doctrine of the Elements, that they mutually ſtrengthen and ſupport each other. But ſince 'tis forbidden me to inſiſt on Reflections of this kind, I muſt proceed to tell You, that though the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105458:20"/>Aſſertors of the four Elements value Reaſon ſo highly, and are furniſh'd with Arguments enough drawn from thence, to be ſatisfi'd that there muſt be four Elements, though no Man had ever yet made any ſenſible tryal to diſcover their Number, yet they are not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Experience to ſatisfie others that are wont to be more ſway'd by their ſenſes then their Reaſon. And I ſhall proceed to conſider the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Experience, when I ſhall have firſt advertis'd You, that if Men were as perfectly rational as 'tis to be wiſh'd they were, this ſenſible way of Probation would be as needleſs as 'tis wont to be imperfect. For it is much more high and Philoſophical to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things <hi>a priore,</hi> then <hi>a posteriore.</hi> And therefore the Peripateticks have not been very ſollicitous to gather Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to prove their Doctrines, contenting themſelves with a few only, to ſatisfie thoſe that are not capable of a Nobler Conviction. And indeed they employ Experiments rather to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate then to demonſtrate their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as Aſtronomers uſe Sphaeres of paſtboard, to deſcend to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105458:20"/>of ſuch as muſt be taught by their ſenſes, for want of being arriv'd to a clear apprehenſion of purely Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Notions and Truths. I ſpeak thus <hi>Eleutherius</hi> (adds <hi>Themistius</hi>) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do right to Reaſon, and not out of Diffidence of the Experimental proof I am to alledge. For though I ſhall name but one, yet it is ſuch a one as will make all other appear as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as it ſelf will be found Satisfactory. For if You but conſider a piece of green-Wood burning in a Chimney, You will readily diſcern in the disbanded parts of it the four Elements, of which we teach It and other mixt bodies to be compos'd. The fire diſcovers it ſelf in the flame by its own light; the ſmoke by aſcending to the top of the chimney, and there readily vaniſhing into air, like a River loſing it ſelf in the Sea, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſts to what Element it belongs and gladly returnes. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in its own form boyling and hiſſing at the ends of the burning Wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes it ſelf to more then one of our ſenſes; and the aſhes by their weight, their firineſs, and their dryneſs, put it paſt doubt that they belong to the Element
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105458:21"/>of Earth. If I ſpoke (continues <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtius</hi>) to leſs knowing Perſons, I would perhaps make ſome Excuſe for building upon ſuch an obvious and eaſie <hi>Analyſis,</hi> but 'twould be, I fear, injurious, not to think ſuch an Apology needleſs to You, who are too judicious either to think it neceſſary that Experiments to prove obvious truths ſhould be farr fetch'd, or to wonder that among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mixt Bodies that are compounded of the four Elements, ſome of them ſhould upon a ſlight <hi>Analyſis</hi> manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibite the Ingredients they conſiſt of. Eſpecially ſince it is very agreeable to the Goodneſs of Nature, to diſcloſe, even in ſome of the moſt obvious Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments that Men make, a Truth ſo important, and ſo requiſite to be taken notice of by them. Beſides that our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis</hi> by how much the more obvious we make it, by ſo much the more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it will be to the Nature of that Doctrine which 'tis alledged to prove, which being as clear and intelligible to the Underſtanding as obvious to the ſenſe, tis no marvail the learned part of Mankind ſhould ſo long and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally imbrace it. For this Doctrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105458:21"/>is very different from the whimſeys of <hi>Chymiſts</hi> and other Modern Innovators, of whoſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> we may obſerve, as Naturaliſts do of leſs perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that as they are haſtily form'd, ſo they are commonly ſhort liv'd. For ſo theſe, as they are often fram'd in one week, are perhaps thought fit to be laughed at the next; and being built perchance but upon two or three Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments are deſtroyed by a third or fourth, whereas the doctrine of the four Elements was fram'd by <hi>Aristotle</hi> after he had leaſurely conſidered thoſe Theories of former Philoſophers, which are now with great applauſe revived, as diſcovered by theſe latter ages; And had ſo judiciouſly detected and ſupplyed the Errors and defects of former <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes</hi> concerning the Elements, that his Doctrine of them has been ever ſince deſervedly embraced by the letter'd part of Mankind: All the Philoſophers that preceded him having in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ages contributed to the compleatneſs of this Doctrine, as thoſe of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times have acquieſc'd in it. Nor has an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſo deliberately and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely eſtabliſhed been called in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105458:22"/>till in the laſt Century <hi>Paracelfus</hi> and ſome few other ſooty Empiricks, rather then (as they are fain to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) Philoſophers, having their eyes darken'd, and their Brains troubl'd with the ſmoke of their own Furnaces, began to rail at the Peripatetick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they were too illiterate to underſtand, and to tell the credulous World, that they could ſee but three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in mixt Bodies; which to gain themſelves the repute of Inventors, they endeavoured to diſguiſe by calling them, inſtead of Earth, and Fire, and Vapour, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; to which they gave the canting title of Hypoſtatical Principles: but when they came to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe them, they ſhewed how little they underſtood what they meant by them, by diſagreeing as much from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as from the truth they agreed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing: For they deliver their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as darkly as their Proceſſes; and 'tis almoſt as impoſſible for any ſober Man to find their meaning, as 'tis for them to find their Elixir. And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has ſpread their Philoſophy, but their great Brags and undertakings; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which, (ſayes <hi>Themiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105458:22"/>ſmiling) I ſcarce know any thing they have performed worth wondering at, ſave that they have been able to draw <hi>Philoponus</hi> to their Party, and to engage him to the Defence of an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> who knowes ſo well as he does, that Principles ought to be like Diamonds, as well very clear, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſolid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Themistius</hi> having after theſe laſt words declared by his ſilence, that he had finiſhed his Diſcourſe, <hi>Carneades</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, as his Adverſary had done, to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> returned this Anſwer to it. I hop'd for Demonſtration, but I perceive <hi>Themistius</hi> hopes to put me off with a Harangue, wherein he cannot have given me a greater Opinion of his Parts, then he has given me Diſtruſt for his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> ſince for it even a Man of ſuch Learning can bring no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Rhetorical part of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, though it make not the leaſt part of it, I ſhall ſay nothing to, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to examine only the Argumentative part, and leaving it to <hi>Philoponus</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe paſſages wherein either <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> or <hi>Chymists</hi> are concern'd: I ſhall obſerve to You, that in what he has ſaid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105458:23"/>beſides, he makes it his Buſineſs to do theſe two things. The one to propoſe and make out an Experiment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the common Opinion about the four Elements; And the other, to inſinuate divers things which he thinks may repair the weakneſs of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Experience, and upon other Accounts bring ſome credit to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe defenceleſs Doctrine he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with his Experiment of the burning Wood, it ſeems to me to be obnoxious to not a few conſiderable Exceptions.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, if I would now deal rigidly with my Adverſary, I might here make a great Queſtion of the very way of Probation which he and others employ, without the leaſt ſcruple, to evince, that the Bodies commonly call'd mixt, are made up of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, which they are pleas'd alſo to call Elements; namely that upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>Analyſis</hi> made by the fire, of the former ſort of <hi>Concretes,</hi> there are wont to emerge Bodies reſembling thoſe which they take for the Elements. For not to Anticipate here what I foreſee I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105458:23"/>ſhall have occaſion to inſiſt on, when I come to diſcourſe with <hi>Philoponus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the right that fire has to paſs for the proper and Univerſal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Analyſing mixt Bodies, not to Anticipate that, I ſay, if I were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to wrangle, I might alledge, that by <hi>Themiſtius</hi> his Experiment it would appear rather that thoſe he calls Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are made of thoſe he calls mixt Bodies, then mix'd Bodies of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For in <hi>Themistius</hi>'s Analyz'd Wood, and in other Bodies diſſipated and alter'd by the fire, it appears, and he confeſſes, that which he takes for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Fire and Water, are made out of the Concrete; but it appears not that the Concrete was made up of Fire and Water. Nor has either He, or any Man, for ought I know, of his perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet prov'd that nothing can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from a Body by the fire that was not <hi>Pre-exiſtent</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>At this unexpected objection, not only <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> but the reſt of the company appear'd not a little ſurpriz'd; but after a while <hi>Philoponus</hi> conceiving his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> concern'd in that Objection, You cannot ſure
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105458:24"/>(ſayes he to <hi>Carneades</hi>) propoſe this Difficulty, not to call it Cavill, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as an Exerciſe of wit, and not as laying any weight upon it. For how can that be ſeparated from a thing that was not exiſtent in it. When, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Refiner mingles Gold and Lead, and expoſing this Mixture upon a Cuppell to the violence of the fire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeparates it into pure and reſulgent Gold and Lead (which driven off toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Droſs of the Gold is thence call'd <hi>Lithargyrium Auri</hi>) can any man doubt that ſees theſe two ſo differing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeparated from the Maſs, that they were exiſtent in it before it was committed to the fire.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould (replies <hi>Carneades</hi>) allow your Argument to prove ſomething, if, as Men ſee the Refiners commonly take before hand both Lead and Gold to make the Maſs you ſpeak of, ſo we did ſee Nature pull down a parcell of the Element of Fire, that is fancy'd to be plac'd I know not how many thouſand Leagues off, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the Orb of the Moon, and to blend it with a quantity of each of the three other Elements, to compoſe every mixt Body, upon whoſe Reſolution the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105458:24"/>Fire preſents us with Fire, and Earth, and the reſt. And let me add, <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that to make your Reaſoning co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, it muſt be firſt prov'd, that the fire do's only take the Elementary Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents aſunder, without otherwiſe alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For elſe 'tis obvious, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may afford ſubſtances which were not pre-exiſtent in them; as Fleſh too long kept produces Magots, and old Cheeſe Mites, which I ſuppoſe you will not affirm to be Ingredients of thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Now that fire do's not alwayes barely ſeparate the Elementary parts, but ſometimes at leaſt alter alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Bodies, if I did not expect ere long a better occaſion to prove it, I might make probable out of your very Inſtance, wherein there is nothing Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſeparated by the great violence of the Refiners fire: the Gold and Lead which are the two Ingredients ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Analyſis</hi> being confeſſedly yet perfectly mixt Bodies, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge being Lead indeed; but ſuch Lead as is differing in conſiſtence and other Qualities from what it was before. To which I muſt add that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen, and ſo queſtionleſſe have you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105458:25"/>much oftener, ſome parcells of Glaſſe adhering to the Teſt or Cuppel, and this Glaſs though Emergent as well as the Gold or Litharge upon your Analyſis, you will not I hope allow to have been a third Ingredient of the Maſs out of which the fire produc'd it.</p>
                  <p>Both <hi>Philoponus</hi> and <hi>Themiſtius</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reply, when <hi>Eleutherius</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that the Proſecution of this Diſpute would take up time, which might be better employ d, thought fit to prevent them by ſaying to <hi>Carneades:</hi> You made at leaſt half a Promiſe, when you firſt propos'd this Objection, that you would not (now at leaſt) inſiſt on it, nor indeed does it ſeem to be of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to your cauſe, that you ſhould. For though you ſhould grant that there are Elements, it would not follow that there muſt be preciſely four. And therefore I hope you will proceed to acquaint us with your other and more conſiderable Objections againſt <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtius</hi>'s Opinion, eſpecially ſince there is ſo great a Diſproportion in Bulke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Earth, Water and Air, on the one part, and thoſe little parcells of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſubſtances, that the fire ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105458:25"/>from <hi>Concretes</hi> on the other part, that I can ſcarce think that you are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when to loſe no advantage againſt your Adverſary, you ſeem to deny it to be rational, to conclude theſe great ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Bodies to be the Elements, and not the Products of compounded ones.</p>
                  <p>What you alledge (replies <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>) of the Vaſtneſs of the Earth and Water, has long ſince made me will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to allow them to be the greateſt and chief Maſſes of Matter to be met with here below: But I think I could ſhew You, if You would give me leave, that this will prove only that the Elements, as You call them, are the chief Bodies that make up the neighbouring part of the World, but not that they are ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients as every mixt Body muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of. But ſince You challenge me of ſomething of a Promiſe, though it be not an entire one, Yet I ſhall willingly perform it. And indeed I intended not when I firſt mention'd this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to inſiſt on it at preſent againſt <hi>Themistius,</hi> (as I plainly intimated in my way of propoſing it:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only deſirous to let you ſee, that though I diſcern'd my Advantages, yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105458:26"/>I was willing to forego ſome of them; rather then appear a rigid Adverſary of a Cauſe ſo weak, that it may with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be favourably dealt with. But I muſt here profeſs, and deſire You to take Notice of it, that though I paſs on to another Argument, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think this firſt invalid. For You will find in the Progreſs of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that I had ſome reaſon to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very way of Probation imploy'd both by Peripateticks and Chymiſts, to evince the being and number of the Elements. For that there are ſuch, and that they are wont to be ſeparated by the Analyſis made by Fire, is indeed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted by both Parties, but has not (for ought I know) been ſo much as plauſibly attempted to be proved by either. Hoping then that when we come to that part of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, wherein Conſiderations relating to this Matter are to be treated of, you will remember what I have now ſaid, and that I do rather for a while ſuppoſe, then abſolutely grant the truth of what I have queſtion'd, I will proceed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Objection.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon <hi>Eleutherius</hi> having
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105458:26"/>mis'd him not to be unmindfull, when time ſhould ſerve, of what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) in the next place, that there are divers Bodies out of which <hi>Themiſtius</hi> will not prove in haſte, that there can be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elements as four extracted by the Fire. And I ſhould perchance trouble him if I ſhould ask him what Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick can ſhew us, (I ſay not, all the four Elements, for that would be too rigid a Queſtion, but) any one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of Gold by any degree of Fire whatſoever. Nor is Gold the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodie in Nature that would puzzle an <hi>Ariſtotelian,</hi> that is no more to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyze by the Fire into Elementary Bodies, ſince, for ought I have yet obſerv'd, both Silver and calcin'd <hi>Venetian</hi> Talck, and ſome other Concretes, not neceſſary here to be nam'd, are ſo fixt, that to reduce any of them into four Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Subſtances has hitherto prov'd a Task much too hard, not only for the Diſciples of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> at leaſt, whilſt the latter have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd only Fire to make the <hi>Analyſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Argument (continues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105458:27"/>that I ſhall urge againſt <hi>Themiſtius</hi>'s Opinion ſhall be this, That as there are divers Bodies whoſe <hi>Analyſts</hi> by Fire cannot reduce them into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heterogeneous Subſtances or Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients as four, ſo there are others which may be reduc'd into more, as the Blood (and divers other parts) of Men and other Animals, which yield when analyz'd five diſtinct Subſtances, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth, as Experience has ſhewn us in diſtilling Mans Blood, Harts-Horns, and divers other Bodies that belonging to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal-Kingdom abound with not uneaſily ſequeſtrable Salt.</p>

                  <head>THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The First Part.</head>
                  <p>I Am (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) ſo unwilling to deny <hi>Eleutherius</hi> any thing, that though, before the reſt of the Company I am reſolv'd to make good the part I have undertaken of a Sceptick; yet I ſhall readily, ſince you will have it ſo, lay aſide for a while the Perſon of an Adverſary to the Peripateticks and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts; and before I acquaint you with my Objections againſt their Opinions, acknowledge to you what may be (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly or not) tollerably enough added, in favour of a certain number of Principles of mixt Bodies, to that grand and known Argument from the <hi>Analyſis</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105458:29"/>of compound Bodies, which I may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hereafter be able to confute.</p>
                  <p>And that you may the more eaſily Examine, and the better Judge of what I have to ſay, I ſhall caſt it into a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty number of diſtinct Propoſitions, to which I ſhall not premiſe any thing; becauſe I take it for granted, that you need not be advertis'd, that much of what I am to deliver, whether for or againſt a determinate number of Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of mix'd Bodies, may be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently apply'd to the four Peripatetick Elements, and the three Chymical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, though divers of my Objections will more peculiarly belong to theſe laſt nam'd, becauſe the Chymical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſeeming to be much more countenanc'd by Experience then the other, it will be expedient to inſiſt chiefly upon the diſproving of that; eſpecially ſince moſt of the Arguments that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd againſt it, may, by a little varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be made to conclude, at leaſt as ſtrongly againſt the leſs plauſible, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To proceed then to my Propoſitions, I ſhall begin with this, That</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſ. </seg>I</label> It ſeems not abſurd to conceive that at the first Production of mixt Bodies, the Univerſal Matter whereof they among other Parts of the Univerſe conſiſted, was actually divided into little Particles of ſeveral ſizes and ſhapes variouſly mov'd.</q>
                  <p>This (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) I ſuppoſe you will eaſily enough allow. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which happens in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Corruption, Nutrition, and waſting of Bodies, that which we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partly by our <hi>Microſcopes</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream littleneſſe of even the ſcarce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts of Concretes; and partly by the Chymical Reſolutions of mixt Bodies, and by divers other Operations of Spagyrical Fires upon them, ſeems ſufficiently to manifeſt their conſiſting of parts very minute and of differing Figures. And that there does alſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene a various local Motion of ſuch ſmall Bodies, will ſcarce be denied; whether we chuſe to grant the Origine of Concretions aſſign'd by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or that related by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For the firſt, as you well know, ſuppoſes not only all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105458:30"/>mixt Bodies, but all others to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the various and caſual occurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Atomes, moving themſelves to and fro by an internal Principle in the Immenſe or rather Infinite <hi>Vacuum.</hi> And as for the inſpir'd Hiſtorian, He, informing us that the great and Wiſe Author of Things did not immediately create Plants, Beaſts, Birds, &amp;c. but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them out of thoſe portions of the pre-exiſtent, though created, Matter, that he calls Water and Earth, allows us to conceive, that the conſtituent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles whereof theſe new Concretes were to conſiſt, were variouſly moved in order to their being connected into the Bodies they were, by their various Coalitions and Textures, to compoſe.</p>
                  <p>But (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) preſuming that the firſt Propoſition needs not be longer inſiſted on, I will paſs on to the ſecond, and tell you that</p>
                  <q>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſ. </seg>II</label> Neither is it impoſſible that of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Particles divers of the ſmalleſt and neighbouring ones were here and there aſſociated into minute Maſſes or Cluſters, and did by their Coalitions conſtitute great store of ſuch little primary Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105458:30"/>or Maſſes as were not eaſily diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable into ſuch Particles as compos'd them.</q>
                  <p>To what may be deduc'd, in favour of this Aſſertion, from the Nature of the Thing it ſelf, I will add ſomething out of Experience, which though I have not known it uſed to ſuch a purpoſe, ſeems to me more fairly to make out that there May be Elementary Bodies, then the more queſtionable Experiments of Peripateticks and Chymiſts prove that there Are ſuch. I conſider then that Gold will mix and be colliquated not only with Silver, Copper, Tin and Lead, but with Antimony, <hi>Regulus Martis</hi> and many other Minerals, with which it will compoſe Bodies very differing both from Gold, and the other Ingredients of the reſulting Concretes. And the ſame Gold will alſo by common <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> and (I ſpeak it knowingly) by divers other <hi>Menſtruums</hi> be reduc'd into a ſeeming Liquor, in ſo much that the Corpuſcles of Gold will, with thoſe of the <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> paſs through Cap-Paper, and with them alſo coagulate into a Cryſtalline Salt. And I have further try'd, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105458:31"/>with a ſmall quantity of a certain Saline Subſtance I prepar'd, I can eaſily enough ſublime Gold into the form of red Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls of a conſiderable length; and many other wayes may Gold be diſguis'd, and help to conſtitute Bodies of very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Natures both from It and from one another, and nevertheleſſe be afterward reduc'd to the ſelf-ſame Numerical, Yellow, Fixt, Ponderous and Malleable Gold it was before its commixture. Nor is it only the fixedſt of Metals, but the moſt fugitive, that I may employ in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our Propoſition: for Quickſilver will with divers Metals compoſe an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malgam,</hi> with divers <hi>Menſtruums</hi> it ſeems to be turnd into a Liquor, with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> it will be brought into either a red or white Powder or precipitate, with Oyl of Vitriol into a pale Yellow one, with Sulphur it will compoſe a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and volatile Cinaber, with ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Bodies it will aſcend in form of a Salt which will be diſſoluble in water; with <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony and Silver I have ſeen it ſublim'd into a kinde of Cryſtals, with another Mixture I reduc'd it into a malleable Body, into a hard and brittle Subſtance by another: And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105458:31"/>ſome there are who affirm, that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Additaments they can reduce Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver into Oyl, nay into Glaſs, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more. And yet out of all theſe exotick Compounds, we may recover the very ſame running Mercury that was the main Ingredient of them, and was ſo diſguis'd in them. Now the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (proceeds <hi>Carneades</hi>) that I have repreſented theſe things concerning Gold and Quickſilver, is, That it may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear abſurd to conceive, that ſuch little primary Maſſes or Cluſters, as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition mentions, may remain undiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, notwithſtanding their entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the compoſition of various Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince the Corpuſcle of Gold and Mercury, though they be not primary Concretions of the moſt minute Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of matter, but confeſſedly mixt Bodies, are able to concurre plentifully to the compoſition of ſeveral very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Bodies, without loſing their own Nature or Texture, or having their cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion violated by the divorce of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated parts or Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to add (ſayes <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>) on this occaſion, to what you now obſerv'd, that as confidently as ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105458:32"/>Chymiſts, and other modern Innovators in Philoſophy are wont to object againſt the Peripateticks, That from the mixture of their four Elements there could ariſe but an inconſiderable variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies; yet if the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> were but half as well vers'd in the works of Nature as they are in the Writings of their Maſter, the propos'd Objection would not ſo calmly triumph, as for want of Experiments they are fain to ſuffer it to do. For if we aſſigne to the Corpuſcles, whereof each Element con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, a peculiar ſize and ſhape, it may eaſily enough be manifeſted, That ſuch differingly figur'd Corpuſcles may be mingled in ſuch various Proportions, and may be connected ſo many ſeveral wayes, that an almoſt incredible number of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly qualified Concretes may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of them. Eſpecially ſince the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of one Element may barely, by being aſſociated among themſelves, make up little Maſſes of differing ſize and figure from their conſtituent parts: and ſince alſo to the ſtrict union of ſuch minute Bodies there ſeems oftentimes nothing requiſite, beſides the bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of a great part of their Surfaces.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105458:32"/>And how great a variety of <hi>Phaenomena</hi> the ſame matter, without the addition of any other, and only ſeveral ways diſpos'd or contexed, is able to exhibit, may partly appear by the multitude of differing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins which by the contrivances of skilful Mechanilians, and the dexterity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Workmen, may be made of Iron alone. But in our preſent caſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to deduce compound Bodies from four very differently qualified ſorts of matter, he who ſhall but conſider what you freſhly took notice of concerning the new Concretes reſulting from the mixture of incorporated Minerals, will ſcarce doubt but that the four Elements mannag'd by Natures Skill may afford a multitude of differing Compounds.</p>
                  <p>I am thus far of your minde (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) that the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> might with probability deduce a much greater number of compound Bodies from the mixture of their four Elements, than according to their preſent <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> they can, if inſtead of vainly attempting to deduce the variety and properties of all mixt Bodies from the Combinations and Temperaments of the four Elements, as they are (among them) endowd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105458:33"/>with the four firſt Qualities, they had endeavoured to do it by the Bulk and Figure of the ſmalleſt parts of thoſe ſuppoſed Elements. For from theſe more Catholick and Fruitfull Accidents of the Elementary matter may ſpring a great variety of Textures, upon whoſe Account a multitude of compound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may very much differ from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And what I now obſerve touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the four Peripatetick Elements, may be alſo applyed, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> (as they ſpeak) to the Chymical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But (to take notice of that by the by) both the one and the other, muſt, I fear, call in to their aſſiſtance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not Elementary, to excite or regulate the motion of the parts of the matter, and diſpoſe them after the manner requiſite to the Conſtitution of particular Concretes. For that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are like to give us but a very imperfect account of the Origine of very many mixt Bodies, It would, I think, be no hard matter to perſwade you, if it would not ſpend time, and were no Digreſſion, to examine, what they are wont to alledge of the Origine of the Textures and Qualities of mixt Bodies,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105458:33"/>from a certain ſubſtantial Form, whoſe Origination they leave more obſcure than what it is aſſum'd to explicate.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to a new Propoſition.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſ. </seg>III</label> I ſhall not peremptorily deny, that from moſt of ſuch mixt Bodies as partake either of Animal or Vegetable Nature, there may by the Help of the Fire, be actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a determinate number (whether Three, Four or Five, or fewer or more) of Subſtances, worthy of differing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations.</q>
                  <p>Of the Experiments that induce me to make this Conceſſion, I am like to have occaſion enough to mention ſeveral in the proſecution of my Diſcourſe.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105458:34"/>yet that it is an Impropriety of Speech, and conſequently in a matter of this moment not to be altogether overlook'd, You will perhaps think, as well as I, by that time you ſhall have heard the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of my Diſcourſe, by which you will beſt diſcern what Conſtruction to put upon the former Propoſitions, and how far they may be look'd upon, as things that I concede as true, and how far as things I only repreſent as ſpecious enough to be fit to be conſider'd.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Eleutherius</hi> (continues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>) I muſt reſume the perſon of a Sceptick, and as ſuch, propoſe ſome part of what may be either diſlik't, or at leaſt doubted of in the common <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Chymiſts: which if I examine with a little the more freedom, I hope I need not deſire you (a Perſon to whom I have the Happineſſe of being ſo well known) to look upon it as ſomething more ſuitable to the Employment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Company has, for this Meeting, doom'd me; then either to my Humour or my Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>Now though I might preſent you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things againſt the Vulgar Chymical Opinion of the three Principles, and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105458:35"/>Experiments wont to be alledg'd as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of it, yet thoſe I ſhall at preſent offer you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four Capital Conſiderations; touching all which I ſhall only premiſe this in general, That ſince it is not my preſent Task ſo much to aſſert an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of my own, as to give an Account wherefore I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Truth of that of the Chymiſts, it ought not to be expected that all my Objections ſhould be of the moſt cogent ſort, ſince it is reaſon enough to Doubt of a propos'd Opinion, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no cogent Reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>To come then to the Objections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I conſider in the firſt place, That notwithſtanding what common Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have prov'd or taught, it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably enough be Doubted, how far, and in what ſence, Fire ought to be eſteem'd the genuine and univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of analyzing mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>This Doubt, you may remember, was formerly mention'd, but ſo tranſiently diſcours'd of, that it will now be fit to inſiſt upon it; And manifeſt that it was not ſo inconſiderately propos'd as our Adverſaries then imagin'd.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105458:35"/>
                  <p>But, before I enter any farther into this Diſquiſition, I cannot but here take notice, that it were to be wiſh'd, our Chymiſts had clearly inform'd us what kinde of Diviſion of Bodies by Fire muſt determine the number of the Elements: For it is nothing near ſo eaſy as many ſeem to think, to determine diſtinctly the Effects of Heat, as I could eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, if I had leaſure to ſhew you how much the Operations of Fire may be diverſify'd by Circumſtances. But not wholly to paſs by a matter of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I will firſt take notice to you, that <hi>Guajacum</hi> (for Inſtance) burnt with an open Fire in a Chimney, is ſequeſtred into Aſhes and Soot, whereas the ſame Wood diſtill'd in a Retort does yield far other Heterogeneities, (to uſe the <hi>Helmontian</hi> expreſſion) and is reſoly'd into Oyl, Spirit, Vinager, Water and Charcoal; the laſt of which to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Aſhes, requires the being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calcin'd then it can be in a cloſe Veſſel: Beſides having kindled Amber, and held a clean Silver Spoon, or ſome other Concave and ſmooth Veſſel over the Smoak of its Flame, I obſerv'd the Soot into which that Fume condens'd,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105458:36"/>to be very differing from any thing that I had obſerv'd to proceed from the ſteam of Amber purpoſely (for that is not uſual) diſtilled <hi>per ſe</hi> in cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Thus having, for Tryals ſake, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Camphire, and catcht the Smoak that copiouſly aſcended out of the Flame, it condens'd into a Black and unctuous Soot, which would not have been gueſs d by the Smell or other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties to have proceeded from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire: whereas having (as I ſhall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more fully declare) expos'd a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete to a gentle heat in a cloſe Glaſs-Veſſel, it ſublim'd up without ſeeming to have loſt any thing of its whiteneſs, or its Nature, both which it retain'd, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I ſo encreaſed the Fire as to bring it to Fuſion. And, beſides Camphire, there are divers other Bodies (that I elſewhere name) in which the heat in cloſe Veſſels is not wont to make any ſeparation of Heterogeneities, but only a comminution of Parts, thoſe that riſe firſt being Homogeneal with the others, though ſubdivided into ſmaller Particles: whence Sublimations have been ſtiled, <hi>The Pestles of the Chymiſts.</hi> But not here
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105458:36"/>to mention what I elſewhere take notice of, concerning common Brimſtone once or twice ſublim'd, that expos'd to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Fire in Subliming-Pots, it riſes all into dry, and almoſt taſtleſs, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Whereas being expos'd to a naked Fire it affords ſtore of a Saline and Fretting Liquor: Not to mention this, I ſay, I will further obſerve to you, that as it is conſiderable in the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of mixt Bodies, whether the Fire act on them when they are expos'd to the open Air, or ſhut up in cloſe Veſſels, ſo is the degree of Fire by which the <hi>Analyſis</hi> is attempted of no ſmall moment. For a milde <hi>Balneum</hi> will ſever unfermented Blood (for Inſtance) but into Phlegme and <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> the later whereof (which I have ſometimes had) hard, brittle, and of divers Colours, (tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent almoſt like Tortoiſe-ſhell) preſs'd by a good Fire in a Retort yields a Spirit, an Oyl or two, and a volatile Salt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi> It may be alſo pertinent to our preſent Deſigne, to take notice of what happens in the making and diſtilling of Sope; for by one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Fire the Salt, the Water and the Oyl or Greaſe, whereof that factitious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105458:37"/>Concrete is made up, being boyl'd up together are eaſily brought to mingle and incorporate into one Maſs; but by another and further degree of Heat the ſame Maſs may be again divided into an oleagenous, an aqueous, a Saline, and an Earthy part. And ſo we may obſerve that impure Silver and Lead being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd together to a moderate Fire, will thereby be colliquated into one Maſs, and mingle <hi>per minima,</hi> as they ſpeak, whereas a much vehementer Fire will drive or carry off the baſer Metals (I mean the Lead, and the Copper or other Alloy) from the Silver, though not, for ought appears, ſeparate them from one another. Beſides, when a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable abounding in fixt Salt is analyz'd by a naked Fire, as one degree of Heat will reduce it into Aſhes, (as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts themſelves teach us) ſo, by only a further degree of Fire, thoſe Aſhes may be vitrified and turn'd into Glaſs. I will not ſtay to examine how far a meere Chymiſt might on this occaſion demand, If it be lawful for an <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi> to make Aſhes, (which he miſtakes for meere Earth) paſs for an Element, becauſe by one degree of Fire it may be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105458:37"/>produc'd, why a Chymiſt may not upon the like Principle argue, that Glaſs is one of the Elements of many Bodies, becauſe that alſo may be obtain'd from them, barely by the Fire? I will not, I ſay, loſe time to examine this, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that by a Method of applying the Fire, ſuch ſimilar Bodies may be obtain'd from a Concrete, as Chymiſts have not been able to ſeparate; either by barely burning it in an open Fire, or by barely diſtilling it in cloſe Veſſels. For to me it ſeems very conſiderable, and I wonder that men have taken ſo little notice of it, that I have not by any of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wayes of Diſtillation in cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſeen any ſeparation made of ſuch a volatile Salt as is afforded us by Wood, when that is firſt by an open Fire divided into Aſhes and Soot, and that Soot is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards plac'd in a ſtrong Retort, and compell'd by an urgent Fire to part with its Spirit, Oyl and Salt; for though I dare not peremptorily deny, that in the Liquors of <hi>Guajacum</hi> and other Woods diſtill'd in Retorts after the common manner, there may be Saline parts, which by reaſon of the Analogy may pretend to the name of ſome kinde of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105458:38"/>volatile Salts; yet queſtionleſs there is a great diſparity betwixt ſuch Salts and that which we have ſometimes obtain'd upon the firſt Diſtillation of Soot (though for the moſt part it has not been ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the firſt or ſecond Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes not till the third) For we could never yet ſee ſeparated from Woods analyz'd only the vuſgar way in cloſe veſſels any volatile Salt in a dry and Saline form, as that of Soot, which we have often had very Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Geometrically figur'd. And then, whereas the Saline parts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. appear upon diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſluggiſh enough, the Salt of Soot ſeems to be one of the moſt volatile Bodies in all Nature; and if it be well made will readily aſcend with the milde heat of a Furnace, warm 'd only by the ſingle Wieck of a Lamp, to the top of the higheſt Glaſs Veſſels that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made uſe of for Diſtillation: and beſides all this, the taſte and ſmell of the Salt of Soot are exceeding differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe of the Spirits of <hi>Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> &amp;c. and the former not only ſmells and taſtes much leſs like a vegetable Salt, than like that of Harts-horn, and other
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105458:38"/>Animal Concretes; but in divers other Properties ſeems more of Kinne to the Family of Animals, than to that of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Salts, as I may elſewhere (God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting) have an occaſion more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to declare. I might likewiſe by ſome other Examples manifeſt, That the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, to have dealt clearly, ought to have more explicitly and particularly declar'd by what Degree of Fire, and in what manner of Application of it, they would have us Judge a Diviſion made by the Fire to be a true <hi>Analyſis</hi> into their Principles, and the Productions of it to deſerve the name of Elementary Bodies. But it is time that I proceed to mention the particular Reaſons that incline me to Doubt, whether the Fire be the true and univerſal Analyzer of mixt Bodies; of which Reaſons what has been already objected may paſs for one.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I obſerve, That there are ſome mixt Bodies from which it has not been yet made appear, that any degree of Fire can ſeparate either Salt or Sulphur or Mercury, much leſs all the Three. The moſt obvious Inſtance of this Truth is Gold, which is a Body ſo fix'd, and wherein the Elementary
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105458:39"/>Ingredients (if it have any) are ſo firmly united to each other, that we finde not in the operations wherein Gold is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Fire, how violent ſoever, that it does diſcernably ſo much as loſe of its fixedneſſe or weight, ſo far is it from being diſſipated into thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereof one at leaſt is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Fugitive enough; and ſo juſtly did the Spagyricall Poet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where exclaim,</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Cuncta adeo miris illic compagibus haerent.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>And I muſt not omit on this occaſion to mention to you, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Experiment that I remember I met with in
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gaſto Claveus</hi> Apolog. Argur. &amp; Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera.</note> 
                     <hi>Gaſto Claveus,</hi> who, though a Lawyer by Profeſſion, ſeems to have had no ſmall Curioſity and Experience in Chymical affairs: He relates then, that having put into one ſmall Earthen Veſſel an Ounce of the moſt pure Gold, and into another the like weight of pure Silver, he plac'd them both in that part of a Glaſs-houſe Furnace wherein the Workmen keep their Metal, (as our Engliſh Artificers call their Liquid Glaſs) continually melted, and that having there kept both the Gold and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105458:39"/>the Silver in conſtant Fuſion for two Moneths together, he afterwards took them out of the Furnace and the Veſſels, and weighing both of them again, found that the Silver had not loſt above a 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of its weight, but the Gold had not of his loſt any thing at all. And though our Author endeavours to give us of this a Scholaſtick Reaſon, which I ſuppoſe you would be as little ſatisfied with, as I was when I read it; yet for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, which will ſerve our preſent turne, he aſſures us, that though it be ſtrange, yet Experience it ſelf taught it him to be moſt true.</p>
                  <p>And though there be not perhaps any other Body to be found ſo perfectly fix'd as Gold, yet there are divers others ſo fix'd or compos'd, at leaſt of ſo ſtrictly united parts, that I have not yet obſerv'd the Fire to ſeparate from them any one of the Chymiſts Principles. I need not tell you what Complaints the more Candid and Judicious of the Chymiſts themſelves are wont to make of thoſe Boaſters that confidently pretend, that they have extracted the Salt or Sulphur of Quickſilver, when they have diſguis'd it by Additaments, wherewith it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105458:40"/>the Concretes whoſe Names are given it; whereas by a skilfull and rigid <hi>Examen,</hi> it may be eaſily enough ſtript of its Diſguiſes, and made to appear again in the priſtine form of running Mercury. The pretended Salts and Sulphurs being ſo far from being Elementary parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Bodie of Mercurie, that they are rather (to borrow a terme of the Grammarians) De-compound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, made up of the whole Metal and the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or other Additaments imploy'd to diſguiſe it. And as for Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I never could ſee any degree of Fire make it part with any of its three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And though the Experiment lately mentioned from <hi>Claveus</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Suſpition that Silver may be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by Fire, provided it be extreamly violent and very laſting: yet it will not neceſſarily follow, that becauſe the Fire was able at length to make the Silver loſe a little of its weight, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to diſſipate it into its Principles. For firſt I might alledge that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd little Grains of Silver to lie hid in the ſmall Cavities (perhaps glas'd over by a vitrifying heat) in Crucibles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Silver has been long kept in Fuſion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105458:40"/>whence ſome Goldſmiths of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance make a Benefit by grinding ſuch Crucibles to powder, to recover out of them the latent particles of Silver. And hence I might argue, that perhaps <hi>Claveus</hi> was miſtaken, and imagin'd that Silver to have been driven away by the Fire, that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his Crucible, in whoſe pores ſo ſmall a quantity as he miſt of ſo ponderous a Bodie might very well lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, admitting that ſome parts of the Silver were driven away by the violence of the Fire, what proof is there that it was either the Salt, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or the Mercury of the Metal, and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remain'd? For beſides, that the Silver that was left ſee m'd not ſenſibly alter'd, which probably would have appear'd, had ſo much of any one of its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples been ſeparated from it: We finde in other Mineral Bodies of a leſs perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nature than Silver, that the Fire may divide them into ſuch minute parts, as to be able to carry them away with its ſelf, without at all deſtroying their Nature. Thus we ſee that in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105458:41"/>of Silver, the Lead that is mix'd with it (to carry away the Copper or other ignoble Mineral that embaſes the Silver) will, if it be let alone, in time evaporate away upon the Teſt; but if (as is moſt uſual amongſt thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine great quantities of Metals together) the Lead be blown off from the Silver by Bellowes, that which would elſe have gone away in the Form of unheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſteams, will in great part be collected not far from the Silver, in the Form of a darkiſh Powder or Calx, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is blown off from Silver, they call Litharge of Silver.

I might add, that I have not found that from Venetian Talck (I ſay Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, becauſe I have found other kinds of that Mineral more open) from the <hi>Lapis Oſſifragus,</hi> (which the Shops call <hi>Ostio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colla</hi>) from <hi>Muſcovia</hi> Glaſs, from pure and Fuſible Sand, to mention now no other Concretes; thoſe of my Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that have try'd have been able by the Fire to ſeparate any one of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Principles, which you will the leſs ſcruple to believe, if you conſider that Glaſs may be made by the bare Colliquation of the Salt and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Aſhes of a burnt Plant, and that yet common Glaſs, once made, does ſo far reſiſt the violence of the Fire, that moſt Chymiſts think it a Body more undeſtroyable then Gold it ſelf. For if the Artificer can ſo firmly unite ſuch comparative groſs Particles as thoſe of Earth and Salt that make up common Aſhes, into a Body indiſſoluble by Fire; why may not Nature aſſociate in divers Bodies the more minute Elementary Corpuſcles ſhe has at hand too firmly to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105458:42"/>let them be ſeparable by the Fire? And on this Occaſion, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> give me leave to mention to you two or three ſleight Experiments, which will, I hope, be found more pertinent to our preſent Diſcourſe, than at firſt perhaps they will appear. The firſt is, that, having (for Tryals ſake) put a quantity of that Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Concrete, Camphire, into a Glaſs Veſſel, and plac'd it in a gentle Heat, I found it (not leaving behinde, according to my Eſtimate, not ſo much as one Grain) to ſublime to the Top of the Veſſel into Flowers: which in White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Smell, &amp;c. ſeem'd not to differ from the Camphire it ſelf. Another Experiment is that of <hi>Helmont,</hi> who in ſeveral places affirms, That a Coal kept in a Glaſs exactly clos'd will never be calcin'd to Aſhes, though kept never ſo long in a ſtrong Fire. To countenance which I ſhall tell you this Tryal of my own, That having ſometimes diſtilled ſome Woods, as particularly Box, whilſt our <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> remain'd in the Retort, it continued black like Charcoal, though the Retort were Earthen, and kept red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot in a vehement Fire; but as ſoon as ever it was brought out of the candent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105458:42"/>Veſſel into the open Air, the burning Coals did haſtily degenerate or fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, without the Aſſiſtance of any new Calcination, into pure white Aſhes. And to theſe two I ſhall add but this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and known Obſervation, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur (if it be pure and freed from its Vinager) being leaſurely ſublim'd in cloſe Veſſels, riſes into dry Flowers, which may be preſently melted into a Bodie of the ſame Nature with that which afforded them. Though if Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone be burnt in the open Air it gives, you know, a penetrating Fume, which being caught in a Glaſs-Bell condenſes into that acid Liquor called Oyl of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur <hi>per Campanam.</hi> The uſe I would make of theſe Experiments collated with what I lately told you out of <hi>Agricola</hi> is this, That even among the Bodies that are not fixt, there are divers of ſuch a Texture, that it will be hard to make it appear, how the Fire, as Chymiſts are wont to imploy it, can reſolve them into Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Subſtances. For ſome Bodies being of ſuch a Texture that the Fire can drive them into the cooler and leſs hot part of the Veſſels wherein they are included, and if need be, remove them from place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105458:43"/>to place to fly the greateſt heat, more eaſily than it can divorce their Elements (eſpecially without the Aſſiſtance of the Air) we ſee that our Chymiſts cannot Analyze them in cloſe Veſſels, and of other compound Bodies the open Fire can as little ſeparate the Elements. For what can a naked Fire do to Analyze a mixt Bodie, if its component Principles be ſo minute, and ſo ſtrictly united, that the Corpuſcles of it need leſs heat to carry them up, than is requiſite to divide them into their Principles. So that of ſome Bodies the Fire cannot in cloſe Veſſels make any <hi>Analyſis</hi> at all, and others will in the open Air fly away in the Forms of Flowers or Liquors, before the Heat can prove able to divide them into their Principles. And this may hold, whether the various ſimilar parts of a Concrete be combin'd by Nature or by Art; For in factitious <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> we finde the common and the Urinous Salts ſo well mingled, that both in the open Fire, and in ſubliming Veſſels they riſe together as one Salt, which ſeems in ſuch Veſſels irreſoluble by Fire alone. For I can ſhew you <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> which after the ninth Sublimation does ſtill retain its
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105458:43"/>compounded Nature. And indeed I ſcarce know any one Mineral, from which by Fire alone Chymiſts are wont to ſever any Subſtance ſimple enough to deſerve the name of an Element or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For though out of native Cinnaber they diſtill Quickſilver, and though from many of thoſe Stones that the Ancients called <hi>Pyrites</hi> they ſublime Brimſtone, yet both that Quickſilver and this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur being very often the ſame with the common Minerals that are ſold in the Shops under thoſe names, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much compounded Bodies to paſs for the Elements of ſuch. And thus much, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> for the Second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that belongs to my Firſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the others I ſhall the leſſe inſiſt on, becauſe I have dwelt ſo long upon this.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we then in the next place to conſider, That there are divers Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made by other means, which either cannot at all, or elſe cannot ſo well be made by the Fire alone. When Gold and Silver are melted into one Maſs, it would lay a great Obligation upon Refiners and Goldſmiths to teach them the Art of ſeparating them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105458:44"/>by the Fire, without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to ſever them. Whereas they may be very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted by the Affuſion of Spirit of Nitte or <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (which the French therefore call <hi>Eau de Depart:</hi>) ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Metalline part of Vitriol will not be ſo eaſily and conveniently ſeparated from the Saline part even by a violent Fire, as by the Affuſion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Alkalizate Salts in a liquid Form upon the Solution of Vitriol made in common water. For thereby the acid Salt of the Vitriol, leaving the Copper it had corroded to joyn with the added Salts, the Metalline part will be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated to the bottom almoſt like Mud. And that I may not give Inſtances only in De-compound Bodies, I will add a not uſeleſs one of another kinde. Not only Chymiſts have not been able (for ought is vulgarly known) by Fire alone to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate true Sulphur from Antimony; but though you may finde in their Books ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plauſible Proceſſes of Extracting it, yet he that ſhall make as many fruitleſſe Tryals as I have done to obtain it by, moſt of them will, I ſuppoſe, be eaſily perſwaded, that the Productions of ſuch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105458:44"/>Proceſſes are Antimonial Sulphurs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Name than Nature. But though Antimony ſublim'd by its ſelf is reduc'd but to a volatile Powder, or Antimonial Flowers, of a compounded Nature like the Mineral that affords them: yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſome years ago I ſublim'd out of Antimony a Sulphur, and that in greater plenty then ever I ſaw obtain'd from that Mineral, by a Method which I ſhall therefore acquaint you with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chymiſts ſeem not to have taken notice of what Importance ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be in the Indagation of the Nature, and eſpecially of the Number of the Elements. Having then purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Tryals ſake digeſted eight Ounces of good and well powder'd Antimony with twelve Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol in a well ſtopt Glas-Veſſel for about ſix or ſeven Weeks; and having caus'd the Maſs (grown hard and brittle) to be diſtill'd in a Retort plac'd in Sand, with a ſtrong Fire; we found the Antimony to be ſo opened, or alter'd by the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> wherewith it had been digeſted, That whereas crude Antimony, forc'd up by the Fire, ariſes only in Flowers, our Antimony thus handled afforded us
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105458:45"/>partly in the Receiver, and partly in the Neck and at the Top of the Retort, about an Ounce of Sulphur, yellow and brittle like common Brimſtone, and of ſo Sulphureous a ſmell, that upon the unluting the Veſſels it infected the Room with a ſcarce ſupportable ſtink. And this Sulphur, beſides the Colour and Smell, had the perfect Inflamability of common Brimſtone, and would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately kindle (at the Flame of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle) and burn blew like it. And though it ſeem'd that the long digeſtion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Antimony and <hi>Menſtruum</hi> were detain'd, did conduce to the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking of the Mineral, yet if you have not the leaſure to make ſo long a Digeſtion, you may by incorporating with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Antimony a convenient Quantity of Oyl of Vitriol, and committing them immediately to Diſtillation, obtain a little Sulphur like unto the common one, and more combuſtible than perhaps you will at firſt take notice of. For I have obſerv'd, that though (after its being firſt kindled) the Flame would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go out too ſoon of its ſelf, if the ſame Lump of Sulphur were held again to the Flame of a Candle, it would be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105458:45"/>rekindled and burn a pretty while, not only after the ſecond, but after the third or fourth accenſion. You, to whom I think I ſhewed my way of diſcovering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Sulphureous in Oyl of Vitriol, may perchance ſuſpect, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that this Subſtance was ſome Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Sulphur that lay hid in that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and was by this operation only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into a manifeſt Body; or elſe that it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the Antimony,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. Cap. 6.</note> and the Saline ones of the Vitriol, in regard that (as <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> informs us) divers learned men would have Sulphur to be nothing but a mixture made in the Bowels of the Earth of Vitriolate Spirits and a certain combuſtible Subſtance. But the Quantity of Sulphur we obtain'd by Digeſtion was much too great to have been latent in the Oyl of Vitriol. And that Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Spirits are not neceſſary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſuch a Sulphur as ours, I could eaſily manifeſt, if I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the ſeveral wayes by which I have obtain'd, though not in ſuch plenty, a Sulphur of Antimony, colour'd and combuſtible like common Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. And though I am not now minded
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105458:46"/>to diſcover them, yet I ſhall tell you, that to ſatisfie ſome Ingenious Men, that diſtill'd Vitriolate Spirits are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the obtaining of ſuch a Sulphur as we have been conſidering, I did by the bare diſtillation of only Spirit of Nitre, from its weight of crude Antimony ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, in a ſhort time, a yellow and very inflamable Sulphur, which, for ought I know, deſerves as much the name of an Element, as any thing that Chymiſts are wont to ſeparate from any Mineral by the Fire. I could perhaps tell you of other Operations upon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereby That may be extracted from it, which cannot be forc'd out of it by the Fire; but I ſhall reſerve them for a fitter Opportunity, and only annex at preſent this ſleight, but not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Experiment. That whereas I lately obſerved to you, that the Urinous and common Salts whereof <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> conſiſts, remain'd unſever'd by the Fire in many ſucceſſive Sublimations, they may be eaſily ſeparated, and partly without any Fire at all, by pouring upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete finely powder'd, a Solution of Salt of Tartar, or of the Salt of Wood-Aſhes; for upon your diligently mixing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105458:46"/>of theſe you will finde your Noſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded with a very ſtrong ſmell of Urine, and perhaps too your Eyes forc'd to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the ſame ſubtle and piercing Body that produces the ſtink; both theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects proceeding from hence, that by the Alcalizate Salt, the Sea Salt that enter'd the compoſition of the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is mortify'd and made more fixt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a divorce is made between it and the volatile Urinous Salt, which being at once ſet at liberty, and put into motion, begins preſently to fly away, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Noſtrils and Eyes it meets with by the way. And if the operation of theſe Salts be in convenient Glaſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by warmth, though but by that of a Bath, the aſcending Steams may eaſily be caught and reduc'd into a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant Spirit, abounding with a Salt, which I have ſometimes found to be ſeparable in a Cryſtalline Form. I might add to theſe Inſtances, that whereas Sublimate, conſiſting, as you know, of Salts &amp; Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver combin'd and carried up together by Heat, may be Sublim'd, I know not how often, by a like degree of Fire, without ſuffering any divorce of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent Bodies, the Mercury may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105458:47"/>ſever'd from the adhering Salts, if the Sublimate be diſtill'd from Salt of Tartar, Quick Lime, or ſuch Alcalizate Bodies. But I will rather obſerve to you, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> what divers ingenious men have thought ſomewhat ſtrange; that by ſuch an Additament that ſeems but only to promote the Separation, there may be eaſily obtain'd from a Concrete (that by the Fire alone is eaſily diviſible into all the Elements that Vegetables are ſuppos'd to conſiſt of) ſuch a ſimilar Subſtance as differs in many reſpects from them all, and conſequently has by many of the moſt Intelligent Chymiſts been denied to be contain'd in the mixt Body. For I know a way, and have practis'd it, whereby common Tartat, without the addition of any thing that is not perfectly a Mineral except Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre, may by one Diſtillation in an Earthen Retort be made to afford good ſtore of real Salt, readily diſſoluble in water, which I found to be neither acid, nor of the ſmell of Tartar, and to be almoſt as volatile as Spirit of Wine it ſelf, and to be indeed of ſo differing a Nature from all that is wont to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Fire from Tartar, that divers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105458:47"/>Learned Men, with whom I diſcours'd of it, could hardly be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that ſo fugitive a Salt could be afforded by Tartar, till I aſſur'd it them upon my own Knowledge. And if I did not think you apt to ſuſpect me to be rather too backward than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things, I could convince you by what I have yet lying by me of that anomalous Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth thing that I ſhall alledge to countenance my firſt Conſideration is, That the Fire even when it divides a Body into Subſtances of divers Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences, does not moſt commonly ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyze it into Hypoſtatical Principles, but only diſpoſes its parts into new Textures, and thereby produces Concretes of a new indeed, but yet of a compound Nature. This Argument it will be requiſite for me to proſecute ſo fully hereafter, that I hope you will then confeſs that 'tis not for want of good Proofs that I deſire leave to ſuſpend my Proofs till the <hi>Series</hi> of my Diſcourſe ſhall make it more proper and ſeaſonable to propoſe them.</p>
                  <p>It may be further alledg'd on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of my Firſt Conſideration, That ſome ſuch diſtinct Subſtances may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105458:48"/>from ſome Concretes without Fire, as deſerve no leſs the name of Elementary, than many that Chymiſts extort by the Violence of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>We ſee that the Inflamable Spirit, or as the Chymiſts eſteem it, the Sulphur of Wine, may not only be ſeparated from it by the gentle heat of a Bath, but may be diſtill'd either by the help of the Sun-Beams, or even of a Dunghill, being indeed of ſo Fugitive a Nature, that it is not eaſy to keep it from flying away, even without the Application of external heat. I have likewiſe obſerv'd that a Veſſel full of Urine being plac'd in a Dunghill, the Putrefaction is wont after ſome weeks ſo to open the Body, that the parts disbanding the Saline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will within no very long time, if the Veſſel be not ſtopt, fly away of it ſelf; Inſomuch that from ſuch Urine I have been able to diſtill little or nothing elſe than a nauſeous Phlegme, inſtead of the active and piercing Salt and Spirit that it would have afforded, when firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Fire, if the Veſſel had been carefully ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to conſider in the Fifth place, That it will be very hard to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105458:48"/>prove, that there can no other Body or way be given which will as well as the Fire divide Concretes into ſeveral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Subſtances, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be call'd their Elements or Principles, as well as thoſe ſeparated or produc'd by the Fire. For ſince we have lately ſeen, that Nature can ſucceſſefully employ other Inſtruments than the Fire to ſeparate diſtinct Subſtances from mixt Bodies, how know we, but that Nature has made, or Art may make, ſome ſuch Subſtance as may be a fit Inſtrument to Analyze mixt Bodies, or that ſome ſuch Method may be found by Humane Induſtry or Luck, by whoſe means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies may be reſolv'd into other Subſtances, than ſuch as they are wont to be divided into by the Fire. And why the Products of ſuch an <hi>Analyſis</hi> may not as juſtly be call'd the component Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Bodies that afford them, it will not be eaſy to ſhew, eſpecially ſince I ſhall hereafter make it evident, that the Subſtances which Chymiſts are wont to call the Salts, and Sulphurs, and Mercuries of Bodies, are not ſo pure and Elementary as they preſume, and as their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> requires. And this may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105458:49"/>therefore be the more freely preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chymiſts, becauſe neither the <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> nor the <hi>Helmontians</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it without apparent Injury to their reſpective Maſters. For <hi>Helmont</hi> do's more than once Inform his Readers, that both <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and Himſelf were Poſſeſſors of the famous Liquor, <hi>Alkahest,</hi> which for its great power in reſolving Bodies irreſoluble by Vulgar Fires, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſeems to call <hi>Ignis Gehennae.</hi> To this Liquor he aſcribes, (and that in great part upon his own Experience) ſuch wonders, that if we ſuppoſe them all true, I am ſo much the more a Friend to Knowledge than to Wealth, that I ſhould think the <hi>Alkahest</hi> a nobler and more deſireable Secret than the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone it ſelf. Of this Univerſal Diſſolvent he relates, That having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted with it for a competent time a piece of Oaken Charcoal, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reduc'd into a couple of new and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Liquors, diſcriminated from each other by their Colour and Situation, and that the whole body of the Coal was reduc'd into thoſe Liquors, both of them ſeparable from his Immortal <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which remain'd as fit for ſuch Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105458:49"/>as before. And he moreover tells us in divers places of his Writings, that by this powerful, and unwearied Agent, he could diſſolve Metals, Marchaſites, Stones, Vegetable and Animal Bodies of what kinde ſoever, and even Glaſs it ſelf (firſt reduc'd to powder,) and in a word, all kinds of mixt Bodies in the World into their ſeveral ſimilar Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, without any Reſidence or <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi> And laſtly, we may gather this further from his Informations, That the homogeneous Subſtances obtainable from compound Bodies by his piercing Liquor, were oftentimes different enough both as to Number and as to Nature, from thoſe into which the ſame Bodies are wont to be divided by common Fire. Of which I ſhall need in this place to mention no other proof, then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we know that in our common <hi>Analyſis</hi> of a mixt Body, there remains a terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and very fixt Subſtance, oftentimes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated with a Salt as fixt; Our Author tells us, that by his way he could Diſtill over all Concretes without any <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> and conſequently could make thoſe parts of the Concrete volatile, which in the Vulgar <hi>Analyſis</hi> would have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105458:50"/>been fixt. So that if our Chymiſts will not reject the ſolemn and repeated. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a Perſon, who cannot but be acknowledg'd for one of the greateſt Spagyriſts that they can boaſt of, they muſt not deny that there is to be found in Nature another Agent able to Analyze compound Bodies leſs violently, and both more genuinely and more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally than the Fire. And for my own part, though I cannot but ſay on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion what (you know) our Friend Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is wont to ſay, when he is askt his Opinion of any ſtrange Experiment; <hi>That He that hath ſeen it hath more Reaſon to beleeve it, than He that hath not;</hi> yet I have found <hi>Helmont</hi> ſo faithful a Writer, even in divers of his improbable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (I alwayes except that Extravagant Treatiſe <hi>De Magnetica Vulnerum Curatione,</hi> which ſome of his Friends affirm to have been firſt publiſh'd by his Enemies) that I think it ſomewhat harſh to give him the Lye, eſpecially to what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers upon his own proper Tryal. And I have heard from very credible Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes ſome things, and ſeen ſome others my ſelf, which argue ſo ſtrongly, that a circulated Salt, or a <hi>Menstruum</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:105458:50"/>(ſuch as it may be) may by being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from compound Bodies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral, Animal, or Vegetable, leave them more unlockt than a wary Naturaliſt would eaſily beleeve, that I dare not confidently meaſure the Power of Nature and Art by that of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums,</hi> and other Inſtruments that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chymiſts themſelves are as yet wont to Empoly about the Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Bodies; nor Deny that a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> may at leaſt from this or that particular Concrete obtain ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſimilar Subſtance, differing from any obtainable from the ſame Body by any degree or manner of Application of the Fire. And I am the more backward to deny peremptorily, that there may be ſuch Openers of compound Bodies, becauſe among the Experiments that make me ſpeak thus warily, there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſome in which it appear'd not, that one of the Subſtances not ſeparable by common Fires and <hi>Menſtruums</hi> could retain any thing of the Salt by which the ſeparation was made.</p>
                  <p>And here, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) I ſhould conclude as much of my Diſcourſe as belongs to the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105458:51"/>I propos'd, but that I foreſee, that what I have delivered will appear liable to two ſuch ſpecious Objections, that I cannot ſafely proceed any further till I have examin'd them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, one ſort of Oppoſers will be forward to tell me, That they do not pretend by Fire alone to ſeparate out of all compound Bodies their <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Principles; it being ſufficient that the Fire divides them into ſuch, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they employ other Bodies to collect the ſimilar parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; as 'tis known, that though they make uſe of water to collect the Saline parts of Aſhes from the Terreſtrial wherewith they are blended, yet it is the Fire only that Incinerates Bodies, and reduces the fix'd part of them into the Salt and Earth, where of Aſhes are made up. This Objection is not, I confeſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and I might in great part allow of it, without granting it to make againſt me, if I would content my ſelf to anſwer, that it is not againſt thoſe that make it that I have been diſputing, but againſt thoſe Vulgar Chymiſts, who themſelves believe, and would fain make others do ſo, That the Fire is not only
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105458:51"/>an univerſal, but an adaequate and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inſtrument to analyze mixt Bodies with. For as to their Practice of Extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fix'd Salt out of Aſhes by the Affuſion of Water, 'tis obvious to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that the Water does only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together the Salt the Fire had before divided from the Earth: as a Sieve does not further break the Corn, but only bring together into two diſtinct heaps the Flour and the Bran, whoſe Corpuſcles before lay promiſcuouſly blended together in the Meal. This I ſay I might alleadge, and thereby exempt my ſelf from the need of taking any farther notice of the propos'd Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But not to loſe the Riſe it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me of Illuſtrating the matter under Conſideration, I am content briefly to conſider it, as far forth as my preſent Diſquiſition may be concern'd in it.</p>
                  <p>Not to repeat then what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwer'd, I ſay farther, that though I am ſo civil an Adverſary, that I will allow the Chymiſts, after the Fire has done all its work, the uſe of fair Water to make their Extractions with, in ſuch caſes wherein the Water does not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the Fire to make the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis;</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:105458:52"/>yet ſince I Grant this but upon Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the Water does only waſh off the Saline Particles, which the Fire Alone has Before Extricated in the Analyz'd Body, it will not be Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that this Conceſſion ſhould Extend to other Liquors that may Add to what they Diſſolve, nor ſo much as to other Caſes than thoſe Newly Mentioned: Which Limitation I Deſire You would be Pleas'd to Bear in Mind till I ſhall Anon have Occaſion to make Uſe of it. And This being thus Premis'd, I ſhall Proceed to Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Many of the Inſtances I Propos'd in the Preceding Diſcourſe are Such, that the Objection we are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering will not at all Reach Them. For Fire can no more with the Aſſiſtance of Water than without it Separate any of the Three Principles, either from Gold, Silver, Mercury, or ſome Others of the Concretes named Above.</p>
                  <p>Hence We may Inferre, That Fire is not an Univerſal Analyzer of all Mixt Bodies, ſince of Metals and Minerals, wherein Chymiſts have moſt Exercis'd Themſelves, there Appear ſcarce Any which they are able to Aanlyze by Fire,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105458:52"/>Nay, from which they can Unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Separate ſo much as any One of their Hypoſtatical Principles; Which may well Appear no ſmall Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well to their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> as to their Pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>It will alſo remain True, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Objection, That there may be Other Wayes than the wonted <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis</hi> by Fire, to Separate from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Body Subſtances as Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous as thoſe that Chymiſts Scruple not to Reckon among their <hi>Tria Prima</hi> (as ſome of them, for Brevity Sake, call their Three Principles.)</p>
                  <p>And it Appears, That by Convenient Additaments ſuch Subſtances may be Separated by the Help of the Fire, as could not be ſo by the Fire alone: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Sulphur of Antimony.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, I muſt Repreſent, That ſince it appears too that the Fire is but One of the Inſtruments that muſt be Employ'd in the Reſolution of Bodies, We may Reaſonably Challenge the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of doing Two Things. For when ever any <hi>Menstruum</hi> or other Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Employ'd, together with the Fire to Obtain a Sulphur or a Salt from
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105458:53"/>a Body, We may well take the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Examine, whether or no That <hi>Menſtruum</hi> do barely Help to Separate the Principle Obtain'd by It, or whether there Intervene not a Coalition of the Parts of the Body Wrought upon with Thoſe of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> whereby the Produc'd Concrete may be Judg'd to Reſult from the Union of Both. And it will be farther Allowable for Us to Conſider, how far any Subſtance, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Help of ſuch Additaments, Ought to paſs for one of the <hi>Tria Prima;</hi> ſince by One Way of Handling the ſame Mixt Body it may according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Additaments, and the Method of Working upon it, be made to Afford differing Subſtances from thoſe Obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from it by other Additaments, and another Method, nay and (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what I Formerly told You about Tartar) Differing from any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into which a Concrete is Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Fire without Additaments, though perhaps thoſe Additaments do not, as Ingredients, enter the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Obtained Body, but only Diverſify the Operation of the Fire upon the Concrete; and though that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105458:53"/>Concrete by the Fire alone may be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a Number of Differing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as Great as any of the Chymiſts that I have met with teach us that of the Elements to be. And having ſaid thus much (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection likely to be Propos'd by ſome Chymiſts, I am now to Examine that which I Foreſee will be Confidently preſs'd by Divers Peripateticks, who, to Prove Fire to be the true Analyzer of Bodies, will Plead, That it is the very Definition of Heat given by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and Generally Received, <hi>Congregare Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenea, &amp; Heterogenea Segregare,</hi> to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Things of a Reſembling, and Disjoyn thoſe of a Differing Nature. To this I anſwer, That this Effect is far from being ſo Eſſential to Heat, as 'tis Generally Imagin'd; for it rather Seems, that the True and Genuine Property of Heat is, to ſet a Moving, and thereby to Diſſociate the parts of Bodies, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide them into Minute Particles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to their being Homogeneous or Heterogeneous, as is apparent in the Boyling of Water, the Diſtillation of Quickſilver, or the Expoſing of Bodies to the action of the Fire, whoſe Parts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105458:54"/>either Are not (at leaſt in that Degree of Heat Appear not) Diſſmilar, where all that the Fire can do, is to Divide the Body into very Minute Parts which are of the ſame Nature with one another, and with their <hi>Totum,</hi> as their Reduction by Condenſation Evinces. And even when the Fire ſeems moſt ſo <hi>Congregare Homogenea, &amp; Segregare Heterogenea,</hi> it Produces that Effect but by Accident; For the Fire does but Diſſolve the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather Shatter the Frame, or [tructure that kept the Heterogeneous Parts of Bodies together, under one Common Form; upon which Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the Component Particles of the Mixt, being Freed and ſet at Liberty, do Naturally, and oftentimes without any Operation of the Fire, Aſſociate themſelves each with its Like, or rather do take thoſe places which their Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Degrees of Gravity and Levity, Fixedneſs or Volatility (either Natural, or Adventitious from the Impreſſion of the Fire) Aſſigne them. Thus in the Diſtillation (for Inſtance) of Man's Blood, the Fire do's Firſt begin to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the <hi>Nexus</hi> or Cement of the Body; and then the Water, being the moſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105458:54"/>Volatile, and Eaſy to be Extracted, is either by the Igneous Atomes, or the Agitation they are put into by the Fire, firſt carried up, till Forſaken by what carried it up, its Weight ſinks it down into the Receiver: but all this while the other Principles of the Concrete Remain Unſever'd, and Require a ſtronger De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat to make a Separation of its more Fixt Elements; and therefore the Fire muſt be Increas'd which Carries over the Volatile Salt and the Spirit, they being, though Beleev'd to be Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles, and though Really of Different Conſiſtency, yet of an almoſt Equal Volatility. After them, as leſs Fugitive, comes over the Oyl, and leaves behinde the Earth and the <hi>Alcali,</hi> which being of an Equal Fixedneſſe, the Fire Severs them not, for all the Definition of the Schools. And if into a Red-hot Earthen or Iron Retort you caſt the Matter to be Diſtill'd, You may Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as I have often done, that the Predominant Fire will Carry up all the Volatile Elements Confuſedly in one Fume, which will afterwards take their Places in the Receiver, either according to the Degree of their Gravity, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105458:55"/>to the Exigency of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Textures; the Salt Adhering, for the moſt part, to the Sides and Top, and the Phlegme Faſtening it ſelf there too in great Drops, the Oyle and Spirit placing themſelves Under, or Above one another, according as their Ponderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes them Swim or Sink. For 'tis Obſervable, that though Oyl or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Sulphur be one of the Elements Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by this Fiery <hi>Analyſis,</hi> yet the Heat which Accidentally Unites the Particles of the other Volatile Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, has not alwayes the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this, there being divers Bodies which Yield Two Oyls, whereof the One ſinks to the Bottom of that Spirit on which the other Swims; as I can ſhew You in ſome Oyls of the ſame Deers Blood, which are yet by Me: Nay I can ſhew you Two Oyls carefully made of the ſame Parcel of Humane Blood, which not only Differ extreamly in Colour, but Swim upon one another without Mixture, and if by Agitation Confounded will of themſelves Divorce again.</p>
                  <p>And that the Fire doth oftentimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Bodies, upon the account that ſome
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105458:55"/>of their Parts are more Fixt, and ſome more Volatile, how far ſoever either of theſe Two may be from a pure Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Nature, is Obvious enough, if Men would but heed it in the Burning of Wood, which the Fire Diſſipates into Smoake and Aſhes: For not only the latter of theſe is Confeſſedly made up of two ſuch Differing Bodies as Earth and Salt; but the Former being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd into that Soot which adheres to our Chimneys, Diſcovers it ſelf to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both Salt and Oyl, and Spirit and Earth, (and ſome Portion of Phlegme too) which being, all almoſt, Equally Volatile to that Degree of Fire which Forces them up, (the more Volatile Parts Helping perhaps, as well as the Urgency of the Fire, to carry up the more Fixt ones, as I have often Try'd in Dulcify'd <hi>Colcothar,</hi> Sublim'd by <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> Blended with it) are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Up together, but may afterwards be Separated by other Degrees of Fire, whoſe orderly Gradation allowes the Diſparity of their Volatileneſs to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf. Beſides, if Differing Bodies United into one Maſs be both ſufficiently Fixt, the Fire finding no Parts Volatile
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105458:56"/>enough to be Expell'd or carried up, makes no Separation at all; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a Mixture of Colliquated Silver and Gold, whoſe Component Metals may be eaſily Sever'd by <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> (according to the Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy of the Silver or the Gold) but in the Fire alone, though vehement, the Metals remain unſever'd, the Fire only dividing the Body into ſmaller Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (whoſe Littleneſſe may be argu'd from their Fluidity) in which either the little nimble Atoms of Fire, or its brisk and numberleſs ſtrokes upon the Veſſels, hinder Reſt and Continuity, without any Sequeſtration of Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Principles. Moreover, the Fire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does not Separate, ſo much as Unite, Bodies of a differing Nature; provided they be of an almoſt reſembling Fixedneſs, and have in the Figure of their Parts an Aptneſs to Coalition, as we ſee in the making of many Plaiſters, Oyntments, &amp;c. And in ſuch Metalline Mixtures as that made by Melting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether two parts of clean Braſs with one of pure Copper, of which ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Trades-men caſt ſuch curious Patterns (for Gold and Silver Works)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105458:56"/>as I have ſometimes taken great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to Look upon. Sometimes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mingled by the Fire are Differing enough as to Fixidity and Volatility, and yet are ſo combin'd by the firſt Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Fire, that it ſelf does ſcarce afterwards Separate them, but only Pulverize them; whereof an Inſtance is afforded us by the Common Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> where the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles of the Vitriol, Sea Salt, and ſometimes Nitre, Employ'd to make the Sublimate, do ſo unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Mercurial Particles made uſe of, firſt to Make Sublimate, and then to Dulcifie it, that the Saline and Metalline Parts ariſe together in many ſucceſſive Sublimations, as if they all made but one Body. And ſometimes too the Fire does not only not Sever the Differing Elements of a Body, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine them ſo firmly, that Nature her ſelf does very ſeldom, if ever, make Unions leſs Diſſoluble. For the Fire meeting with ſome Bodies exceedingly and almoſt equally Fixt, inſtead of making a Separation, makes an Union ſo ſtrict, that it ſelf, alone, is unable to Diſſolve it; As we ſee, when an Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105458:57"/>Salt and the Terreſtrial Reſidue of the Aſhes are Incorporated with pure Sand, and by Vitrification made one permanent Body, (I mean the courſe or greeniſh ſort of Glaſs) that mocks the greateſt Violence of the Fire, which though able to Marry the Ingredients of it, yet is not able to Divorce them. I can ſhew you ſome pieces of Glaſs which I ſaw flow down from an Earthen Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible purpoſely Expos'd for a good while, with Silver in it, to a very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fire. And ſome that deal much in the Fuſion of Metals Informe me, that the melting of a great part of a Crucible into Glaſs is no great Wonder in their Furnaces. I remember, I have Obſerv'd too in the Melting of great Quantities of Iron out of the Oar, by the Help of ſtore of Charcoal (for they Affirm that Sea-Coal will not yield a Flame ſtrong enough) that by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Vehemence of the Fire, Excited by vaſt Bellows (made to play by great Wheels turn'd about by Water) part of the Materials Expos'd to it was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Analyz'd, Colliquated, and turn'd into a Dark, Solid and very Ponderous Glaſs, and that in ſuch Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105458:57"/>that in ſome places I have ſeen the very High-wayes, neer ſuch Iron-works, mended with Heaps of ſuch Lumps of Glaſſe, inſtead of Stones and Gravel. And I have alſo Obſerv'd, that ſome kind of Fire-ſtone it ſelf, having been employ'd in Furnaces wherein it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to very ſtrong and laſting Fires, has had all its Fixt Parts ſo Wrought on by the Fire, as to be Perfectly Vitrifi'd, which I have try'd by Forcing from it Pretty large Pieces of Perfect and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Glaſs. And leſt You might think, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> that the Queſtion'd Definition of Heat may be Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the Definition which is wont to be given and Acquieſc'd in, of its contrary Quality, Cold, whoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is taught to be <hi>tam Homogenea, quam Heterogenea congregare;</hi> Give me leave to repreſent to You, that neither is this Definition unqueſtionable; for not to Mention the Exceptions, which a <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> as ſuch, may Take at it, I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Union of Heterogeneous Bodies which is Suppos'd to be the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Production of Cold, is not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by every Degree of Cold. For we ſee for Inſtance that in the Urine of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105458:58"/>Healthy Men, when the Liquor has been Suffer'd a while to ſtand, the Cold makes a Separation of the Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Part from the Groſſer, which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to the Bottom, and Growes O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacous there; whereas if the Urinal be Warme, theſe Parts readily Mingle again, and the whole Liquor becomes Tranſparent as before. And when, by Glaciation, Wood, Straw, Duſt, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. are Suppos'd to be United into one Lump of Ice, the Cold does not Cauſe any Real Union or Adunation, (if I may ſo Speak) of theſe Bodies, but only Hardening the Aqueous Parts of the Liquor into Ice, the other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being Accidentally Preſent in that Liquor are frozen up in it, but not Really United. And accordingly if we Expoſe a Heap of Mony Conſiſting of Gold, Silver and Copper Coynes, or any other Bodies of Differing Natures, which are Deſtitute of Aqueous Moiſture, Capable of Congelation, to never ſo intenſe a Cold, we find not that theſe Differing Bodies are at all thereby ſo much as Compacted, much leſs United together; and even in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors Themſelves we find <hi>Phaenoment</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:105458:58"/>which Induce us to Queſtion the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which we are examining. If <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his Authority were to be look't upon as a Sufficient Proof in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nature, I might here inſiſt on that Proceſs of his, whereby he Teaches that the Eſſence of Wine may be Sever'd from the Phlegme and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble Part by the Aſſiſtance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation: and becauſe much Weight has been laid upon this Proceſs, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> but other Writers, ſome of whom ſeem not to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd it themſelves, I ſhall give You the entire Paſſage in the Authors own Words, as I lately found them in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Archidoxis,</hi> an Extract whereof I have yet about me; and it ſounds thus. <hi>De Vino ſciendum eſt, fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem phlegmaque ejus eſſe Mineram, &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſubstantiam eſſe corpus in quo conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatur Eſſentia, prout auri in auro latet Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia.

                  <p>But I dare not <hi>Eleu.</hi> lay much Weight upon this Proceſs, becauſe I have found that if it were True, it would be but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Practicable in this Country upon the beſt Wine: for Though this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Winter hath been Extraordinary Cold, yet in very Keen Froſts accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with laſting Snowes, I have not been able in any Meaſure to Freeze a thin Vial full of Sack; and even with Snow and Salt I could Freeze little more then the Surface of it; and I ſuppoſe <hi>Eleu.</hi> that tis not every Degree of Cold that is Capable of Congealing Liquors, which is able to make ſuch an <hi>Analyſis</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:105458:59"/>(if I may ſo call it) of them by Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Aqueous and Spirituous Parts; for I have ſometimes, though not often, frozen ſeverally, Red-wine, Urine and Milk, but could not Obſerve the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Separation. And the Dutch-Men that were forc'd to Winter in that Icie Region neer the Artick Circle, call'd <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> although they relate, as we ſhall ſee below, that there was a Separation of Parts made in their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Beer about the middle of <hi>November,</hi> yet of the Freezing of their Back in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> following they give but this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <hi>Yea and our Sack, which is ſo hot, was Frozen very hard, ſo that when we were every Man to have his part, we were forc'd to melt it in the Fire; which we ſhar'd every ſecond Day, about half a Pinte for a Man, wherewith we were forc'd to ſustain our ſelves.</hi> In which words they imply not, that their Back was divided by the Froſt into differing Subſtances, after ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as their Beer had been. All which notwithſtanding, <hi>Eleu.</hi> ſuppoſe that it may be made to appear, that even Cold ſometimes may <hi>Congregare Homogenea, &amp; Heterogenea Segregare:</hi> and to Manifeſt this I may tell you, that I did once, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105458:60"/>cauſe to be Decocted in fair Water a Plant abounding with Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and Spirituous Parts, and having expos'd the Decoction to a keen North-Wind in a very Froſty Night, I obſerv'd, that the more Aqueous Parts of it were turn'd by the next Morning into Ice, towards the innermoſt part of which, the more Agile and Spirituous parts, as I then conjectur'd, having Retreated, to ſhun as much as might be their Environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, they had there preſerv'd themſelves unfrozen in the Form of a high colour'd Liquor, the Aqueous and Spirituous parts having been ſo ſleightly (Blended rather than) United in the Decoction, that they were eaſily Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by ſuch a Degree of Cold as would not have been able to have Divorc'd the Parts of Urine or Wine, which by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or Digeſtion are wont, as Tryal has inform'd me, to be more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately aſſociated each with other. But I have already intimated, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> that I ſhall not Inſiſt on this Experiment, not only becauſe, having made it but once I may poſſibly have been miſtaken in it; but alſo (and that principally) becauſe of that much more full and eminent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105458:60"/>Experiment of the Separative Virtue of extream Cold, that was made, againſt their Wills, by the foremention'd Dutch men that Winter'd in <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> the Relation of whoſe Voyage being a very ſcarce Book, it will not be amiſs to give you that Memorable part of it which concerns our preſent Theme, as I caus'd the Paſſage to be extracted out of the Engliſhed Voyage it ſelf.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Gerard de Veer, John Cornelyſon</hi> and Others, ſent out of <hi>Amſterdam, Anno Dom.</hi> 1596. being forc'd by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Weather to Winter in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Zembla,</hi> neer Ice-Haven; on the thirteenth of <hi>October,</hi> Three of us (ſayes the Relation) went aboard the Ship, and laded a Sled with Beer; but when we had laden it, thinking to go to our Houſe with it, ſuddenly there aroſe ſuch a Winde, and ſo great a Storm and Cold, that we were forc'd to go into the Ship again, becauſe we were not able to ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and we could not get the Beer into the Ship again, but were forc'd to let it ſtand without upon the Sled: the Fourteenth, as we came out of the Ship, we found the Barrel of Beer
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105458:61"/>ſtanding upon the Sled, but it was faſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen at the Heads; yet by reaſon of the great Cold, the Beer that purg'd out froze as hard upon the Side of the Barrel, as if it had been glu'd thereon: and in that ſort we drew it to our Houſe, and ſet the Barrel an end, and drank it up; but firſt we were forc'd to melt the Beer, for there was ſcarce any unfrozen Beer in the barrel; but in that thick Yieſt that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frozen day the Strength of the Beer, ſo that it was too ſtrong to drink alone, and that which was frozen taſted like Water; and being melted we Mix'd one with the other, and ſo drank it; but it had neither Strength nor Taſte.</q>
                  <p>And on this Occaſion I remember, that having the laſt very Sharp Winter purpoſely try'd to Freeze, among other Liquors, ſome Beer moderately ſtrong, in Glaſs Veſſels, with Snow and Salt, I obſerv'd, that there came out of the Neck a certain thick Subſtance, which, it ſeems, was much better able then the reſt of the Liquor (that I found turn'd into Ice) to reſiſt a Froſt, and which, by its Colour and conſiſtence ſeem'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105458:61"/>enough to be Yieſt, whereat, I confeſs, I ſomewhat marvail'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did not either diſcerne by the Taſte, or find by Enquiry, that the Beer was at all too New to be very fit to be Drank. I might confirm the Dutchmens Relation, by what happen'd a while ſince to a neere Friend of mine, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me, that having Brew'd ſome Beer or Ale for his own drinking in <hi>Holland</hi> (where he then dwelt) the Keenneſs of the late bitter Winter froze the Drink ſo as to reduce it into Ice, and a ſmall Proportion of a very Strong and Spirituous Liquor. But I muſt not entertain you any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Cold, not onely becauſe you may think I have but loſt my way into a Theme which does not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to my preſent Undertaking; but becauſe I have already enlarg'd my ſelf too much upon the firſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I propos'd, though it appears ſo much a Paradox, that it ſeem'd to Require that I ſhould ſay much to keep it from being thought a meere Extravagance; yet ſince I Undertook but to make the common Aſſumption
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105458:62"/>of our Chymiſts and <hi>Aristotelians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Queſtionable, I hope I have ſo Perform'd that Task, that I may now Proceed to my Following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Inſiſt leſſe on them than I have done on the Firſt.</p>

                  <head>THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Second Part.</head>
                  <p>THe Second Conſideration I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have Notice Taken of, is This, That it is not ſo Sure, as Both Chymiſts and <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> are wont to Think it, that every Seemingly Similar or Diſtinct Subſtance that is Separated from a Body by the Help of the Fire, was Pre-exiſtent in it as a Principle or Element of it.</p>
                  <p>That I may not make this Paradox a Greater then I needs muſt, I will Firſt Briefly Explain what the Propoſition means, before I proceed to Argue for it.</p>
                  <p>And I ſuppoſe You will eaſily Believe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105458:63"/>That I do not mean that any thing is ſeparable from a Body by Fire, that was not Materially pre-exiſtent in it; for it Far Exceeds the power of Meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Naturall Agents, and Conſequently of the Fire, to produce anew, ſo Much as one Atome of Matter, which they can but Modifie and Alter, not Create; which is ſo Obvious a Truth, that almoſt all Sects of Philoſophers have Deny'd the Power of producing Matter to Second Cauſes; and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picureans</hi> and ſome Others have Done the Like, in Reference to their Gods themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the Propoſition perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Deny but that ſome Things Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body, may have been more then barely Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially pre-exiſtent in it, ſince there are Concretes, which before they be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Fire afford us ſeveral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of their abounding, ſome with Salt, and Others with Sulphur. For it will ſerve the preſent Turn, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that diverſe things Obtain'd from a Mixt Body expos'd to the Fire, were not its Ingredients Before: for if this be made to appear it, will be Rationall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105458:63"/>to ſuſpect that Chymiſts may De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve themſelves, and Others, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Reſolutely and Univerſally, thoſe Subſtances to be the Elementary Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of Bodies barely ſeparated by the Fire, of which it yet may be Doubted Whether there be ſuch or No; at leaſt till ſome other Argument then that drawn from the <hi>Analyſis</hi> be Brought to reſolve the Doubt.</p>
                  <p>That then which I Mean by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I am Explaining, is, That it may without Abſurdity be Doubted whether or no the Differing Subſtances Obtainable from a Concrete Diſſipated by the Fire were ſo Exſiſtent in it in that Forme (at leaſt as to their minute Parts) wherein we find them when the <hi>Analyſis</hi> is over, that the Fire did only Dis joyne and Extricate the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of one Principle from thoſe of the other wherewith before they were Blended.</p>
                  <p>Having thus Explain'd my Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall endeavour to do two things, to prove it; The firſt of which is to ſhew that ſuch Subſtances as Chymiſts call Principles May be produc'd <hi>De novo</hi> (as they ſpeak.) And the other is to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105458:64"/>make it probable that by the Fire we may Actually obtain from ſome Mixt Bodies ſuch Subſtances as were not in the Newly Expounded ſence, pre-exiſtent in them.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the Firſt of theſe, I Conſider that if it be as true as 'tis probable, that Compounded Bodies Differ from One Another but in the Various Textures Reſulting from the Bigneſs, Shape, Motion, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their ſmal parts. It will not be Irrationall to conceive that one and the ſame parcel of the Univerſal Matter may by Various Alterations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textures be brought to Deſerve the Name, ſomtimes of a Sulphureous, and ſometimes of a Terrene, or Aqueous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this I could more largely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, but that our Friend Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has promis'd us ſomething about Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, wherein the Theme I now willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſign him, Will I Queſtion not be Studiouſly Enquired into. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I ſhall now advance in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of what I have lately Deliver'd ſhall be Deduc'd from Experiments made Divers Years ſince. The firſt of which would have been much more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105458:64"/>conſiderable, but that by ſome intervening Accidents I was Neceſſitated to loſe the beſt time of the year, for a trial of the Nature of that I deſign'd; it being about he middle of <hi>May</hi> before I was able to begin an Experiment which ſhould have then been two moneths old; but ſuch as it was, it will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be impertinent to Give You this Narrative of it. At the time newly Mention'd, I caus'd My Gardiner (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Urgent Occaſions Hinder'd from being preſent myſelf) to dig out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of good Earth, and dry it well in an Oven, to weigh it, to put it in an Earthen pot almoſt level with the Surface of the ground, and to ſet in it a ſelected ſeed he had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from me, for that purpoſe, of Squaſh, which is an Indian kind of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that Growes apace; this ſeed I Ordered Him to Water only with Rain or Spring Water. I did not (when my Occaſions permitted me to viſit it) without delight behold how faſt it Grew, though unſeaſonably ſown; but the Haſtning Winter Hinder'd it from attaining any thing neer its due and Wonted magnitude; (for I found
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105458:65"/>the ſame Autumn, in my Garden, ſome of thoſe plants, by Meaſure, as big about as my Middle) and made me order the having it taken Up; Which about the Middle of <hi>October</hi> was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Done by the ſame Gardiner, who a while after ſent me this account of it; <hi>I have Weighed the Pompion with the Stalk and Leaves, all which Weighed three pound wanting a quarter; Then I took the Earth, baked it as formerly, and found it just as much as I did at Firſt, which made me think I had not dry'd it Sufficiently: then I put it into the Oven twice More, after the Bread was Drawn, and Weighed it the Second time, but found it Shrink little or nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to deal Candidly with You, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi> I muſt not conceal from You the Event of another Experiment of this Kind made this preſent Summer, wherein the Earth ſeems to have been much more Waſted; as may appear by the following account, Lately ſent me by the ſame Gardiner, in theſe Words. <hi>To give You an Account of your Cucumbers, I have Gain'd two Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fair Ones, the Weight of them is ten Pound and a Halfe, the Branches with the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105458:65"/>Roots Weighed four Pounds wanting two Ounces; and when I had weighed them I took the Earth, and bak'd it in ſeveral ſmall Earthen Diſhes in an Oven; and when I had ſo done, I found the Earth wanted a Pound and a halfe of what it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet I was not ſatisfi'd, doubting the Earth was not dry: I put it into an Oven the Second Time, (after the Bread was drawn) and after I had taken it out and weighed it, I found it to be the Same Weight: So I Suppoſe there was no Moiſture left in the Earth. Neither do I think that the Pound and Halfe that was wanting was Drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Cucumber but a great Part of it in the Ordering was in Duſt (and the like) waſted: (the Cucumbers are kept by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt You ſhould ſend for them.</hi>) But yet in this Tryal, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that though ſome of the Earth, or rather the diſſoluble Salt harbour'd in it, were waſted, the main Body of the Plant conſiſted of Tranſmuted Water. And I might add, that a year after I caus'd the formerly mentioned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, touching large Pompions, to be reiterated, with ſo good ſucceſs, that if my memory does not much miſ-inform me, it did not only much ſurpaſs any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105458:66"/>that I made before, but ſeem'd ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conclude what I am pleading for; though (by reaſon I have unhappily loſt the particular Account my Gardiner writ me up of the Circumſtances) I dare not inſiſt upon them. The like Experiment may be as conveniently try'd with the ſeeds of any Plant, whoſe growth is haſty, and its ſize Bulky. If Tobacco will in Theſe Cold Climates Grow well in Earth undung'd, it would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to make a Tryal with it; for 'tis an annual Plant, that ariſes where it proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſometimes as high as a Tall Man; and I have had leaves of it in my Garden neer a Foot and a Halfe broad. But the next time I Try this Experiment, it ſhall be with ſeveral ſeeds of the ſame ſort, in the ſame pot of Earth, that ſo the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent may be the more Conſpicuous. But becauſe every Body has not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of time and place for this Experiment neither, I made in my Chamber, ſome ſhorter and more Expeditions Tryals. I took a Top of Spearmint, about an Inch Long, and put it into a good Vial full of Spring water, ſo as the upper part of the Mint was above the neck of the Glaſs, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105458:66"/>the lower part Immers'd in the Water; within a few Dayes this Mint began to ſhoot forth Roots into the Water, and to diſplay its Leaves, and aſpire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and in a ſhort time it had nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Roots and Leaves, and theſe very ſtrong and fragrant of the Odour of the Mint: but the Heat of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as I ſuppoſe, kill'd the Plant when it was grown to have a pretty thick Stalk, which with the various and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mified Roots, which it ſhot into the Water as if it had been Earth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in its Tranſparent Flower-pot a Spectacle not unpleaſant to behold. The like I try'd with ſweet Marjoram, and I found the Experiment ſucceed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, though ſomewhat more ſlowly, with Balme and Peniroyal, to name now no other Plants. And one of theſe Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, cheriſh'd only by Water, having obtain'd a competent Growth, I did, for Tryals ſake, cauſe to be Diſtill'd in a ſmall Retort, and thereby obtain'd ſome Phlegme, a little Empyrcumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spirit, a ſmall Quantity of aduſt Oyl, and a <hi>Caput mortuum;</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be a Coal concluded it to conſiſt of Salt and Earth: but

                  <p>But perhaps I might have ſav'd a great part of my Labour. For I finde that <hi>Helmont</hi> (an Author more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for his Experiments than many Learned men are pleas'd to think him) having had an Opportunity to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute an Experiment much of the ſame nature with thoſe I have been now ſpeaking of, for five Years together, obtain'd at the end of that time ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a Quantity of Tranſmuted Water,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105458:67"/>that I ſhould ſcarce Think it fit to have his Experiment, and Mine Mention'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were it not that the Length of Time Requiſite to this may deterr the Curioſity of ſome, and exceed the leaſure of Others; and partly, that ſo Paradoxical a Truth as that which theſe Experiments ſeem to hold forth, needs to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by more Witneſſes then one, eſpecially ſince the Extravagancies and Untruths to be met with in <hi>Helmonts</hi> Treatiſe of the Magnetick Cure of Wounds, have made his Teſtimonies ſuſpected in his other Writings, though as to ſome of the Unlikely matters of Fact he delivers in them, I might ſafely undertake to be his Compurgator. But that Experiment of his which I was mentioning to You, he ſayes, was this. He took 200 pound of Earth dry'd in an Oven, and having put it into an Earthen Veſſel and moiſten'd it with Raine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he planted in it the Trunk of a VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tree of five pound VVeight; this he VVater'd, as need required, with Rain or with Diſtill'd VVater; and to keep the Neighbouring Earth from getting into the Veſſell, he employ'd a plate of Iron tinn'd over and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105458:68"/>with many holes. Five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efflux'd, he took out the Tree and weighed' it, and (with computing the leaves that fell during four Autumnes) he found it to weigh 169 pound, and about three Ounces. And Having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Dry'd the Earth it grew in, he found it want of its Former VVeight of 200 Pound, about a couple only of Ounces; ſo that 164 pound of the Roots, VVood, and Bark, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Tree, ſeem to have Sprung from the VVater. And though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not that <hi>Helmont</hi> had the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to make any <hi>Analyſis</hi> of this Plant, yet what I lately told You I did to One of the Vegetables I nouriſh'd with VVater only, will I ſuppoſe keep You from Doubting that if he had Diſtill'd this Tree, it would have afforded him the like Diſtinct Subſtances as another Vegetable of the ſame kind. I need not Subjoyne that I had it alſo in my thoughts to try how Experiments to the ſame purpoſe with thoſe I related to You would ſucceed in other Bodies then Vegetables, becauſe importunate Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations having hitherto hinder'd me from putting my Deſign in Practiſe, I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105458:68"/>can yet ſpeak but Confecturally of the Succeſs: but the beſt is, that the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments already made and mention'd to you need not the Aſſiſtance of new Ones, to Verifie as much as my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent task makes it concern me to prove by Experiments of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>One would ſuſpect (ſayes <hi>Eleutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> after his long ſilence) by what You have been diſcourſing, that You are not far from <hi>Helmonts</hi> Opinion about the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigination of Compound Bodies, and perhaps too diſlike not the Arguments which he imployes to prove it.</p>
                  <p>VVhat <hi>Helmontian</hi> Opinion, and what Arguments do you mean (askes <hi>Carneades.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>VVhat You have been Newly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing (replies <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) tells us, that You cannot but know that this bold and Acute Spagyriſt ſcruples not to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that all mixt Bodies ſpring from one Element; and that Vegetables, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Marchaſites, Stones, Metalls, &amp;c. are Materially but ſimple VVater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd into theſe Various Formes, by the plaſtick or Formative Virtue of their ſeeds. And as for his Reaſons you may find divers of them ſcatter'd up and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105458:69"/>down his writings; the conſiderabl'ſt of which ſeem to be theſe three; The Ultimate Reduction of mixt Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Inſipid VVater, the Viciſſitude of the ſuppoſed Elements, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of perfectly mixt Bodies out of ſimple VVater. And firſt he affirmes that the <hi>Sal circulatus Paracelſi,</hi> or his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> does adaequately reſolve Plants, Animals, and Mineralls into one Liquor or more, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral internall Diſparities of Parts (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> or the Deſtruction of their ſeminal Virtues;) and that the <hi>Alkahest</hi> being abſtracted from theſe Liquors in the ſame weight and Virtue wherewith it Diſſolv'd them, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors may by frequent Cohobations from chalke or ſome other idoneous matter, be Totally depriv'd of their feminal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and return at laſt to their firſt matter, Inſipid VVater; ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes he propoſes here and there, to diveſt ſome particular Bodies of their borrow'd ſhapes, and make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrate to their firſt Simplicity. The ſecond Topick whence <hi>Helmont</hi> drawes his Arguments, to prove VVater to be the Material cauſe of Mixt Bodies, I told
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105458:69"/>You was this, that the other ſuppos'd Elements may be tranſmuted into one another. But the Experiments by him here and there produc'd on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are ſo uneaſie to be made and to be judg'd of, that I ſhall not inſiſt on them; not to mention, that if they were granted to be true, his Inference from them is ſomewhat diſputable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall paſs on to tell You, That as, in his Firſt Argument, our Paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Author endeavours to prove Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sole Element of Mixt Bodies, by their Ultimate Reſolution, when by his <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> or ſome other conquering Agent, the Seeds have been Deſtroy'd, which Diſguis'd them, or when by time thoſe ſeeds are Weari'd or Exantlated or unable to Act their Parts upon the Stage of the Univerſe any Longer: So in his Third Argument he Endeavours to evince the ſame Concluſion, by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Bodies which he aſſerts to be nothing but Water Subdu'd by Seminal Virtues. Of this he gives here and there in his Writings ſeveral Inſtances, as to Plants and Animals; but divers of them being Difficult either to be try'd or to be Underſtood, and others of them being
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105458:70"/>not altogether Unobnoxious to Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I think you have ſingl'd out the Principal and leſs Queſtionable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when you lately mention'd that of the Willow Tree. And having thus, Continues <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> to Anſwer your Queſtion, given you a Summary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I am Confident You know better then I do, I ſhall be very glad to receive Your Sence of it, if the giving it me will not too much Divert You from the Proſecution of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>If</hi> (replies <hi>Carneades</hi>) was not needleſly annex'd: for thorowly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ſuch an Hypotheſis and ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would require ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and Conſequently ſo much time, that I ſhould not now have the Lieſure to perfect ſuch a Digreſſion, and much leſs to finiſh my Principle Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Yet thus much I ſhall tell You at preſent, that you need not fear my rejecting this Opinion for its Novelty; ſince, however the <hi>Helmontians</hi> may in complement to their Maſter pretend it to be a new Diſcovery, Yet though the Arguments be for the moſt part his, the Opinion it ſelf is very Antient: For <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes

Wherefore I ſhall add, to Countenance <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Opinion, That whereas he gives not, that I remember, any Inſtance of any Mineral Body, nor ſcarce of any Animal, generated of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a French Chymiſt, <hi>Monſieur de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> has preſented his Readers an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which if it were punctually ſuch as he has deliver'd it, is very Notable. He then, Diſcourſing of the Generation of things according to certain Chymical and Metaphorical Notions (which I confeſs are not to me Intelligible) ſets down, among divers Speculations not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105458:72"/>pertinent to our Subject, the following Narrative, which I ſhall repeat to you the ſence of in Engliſh, with as little variation from the Literal ſence of the French words, as my memory will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me. <hi>Having</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>diſcern'd ſuch great Wonders by the Natural Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water, I would know what may be done with it by Art Imitating Nature. Wherefore I took Water which I well knew not to be compounded, nor to be mix'd with any other thing than that Spirit of Life</hi> (whereof he had ſpoken before;) <hi>and with a Heat Artificial, Continual and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate, I prepar'd and diſpos'd it by the above mention'd Graduations of Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Congelation, and Fixation, untill it was turn'd into Earth, which Earth produc'd Animals, Vegetables and Minerals. I tell not what Animals, Vegetables and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, for that is reſerv'd for another Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but the Animals did Move of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Eat, &amp;c. — and by the true Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie I made of them, I found that they were compos'd of much Sulphur, little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and leſs Salt. — The Minerals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow and encreaſe by converting into their own Nature one part of the Earth thereunto diſpos'd; they were ſolid and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105458:72"/>heavy. And by this truly Demonstrative Science, namely Chymistry, I found that they were compos'd of much Salt, little Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and leſs Mercury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Carneades)</hi> I have ſome Suſpitions concerning this ſtrange Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which make me unwilling to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare an Opinion of it, unleſs I were ſatisfied concerning divers Material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that our Author has left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; though as for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Living Creatures, both Vegetable and Senſitive, it needs not ſeem Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, ſince we finde that our common water (which indeed is often Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Variety of Seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Rudiments) being long kept in a quiet place will putrifie and ſtink, and then perhaps too produce Moſs and little Worms, or other Inſects, according to the nature of the Seeds that were lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it. I muſt likewiſe deſire you to take Notice, that as <hi>Helmont</hi> gives us no Inſtance of the Production of Minerals out of Water, ſo the main Argument that he employ's to prove that they and other Bodies may be reſolv'd into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is drawn from the Operations of his <hi>Alkahest,</hi> and conſequently cannot
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105458:73"/>be ſatisfactorily Examin'd by You and Me.</p>
                  <p>Yet certainly (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius)</hi> You cannot but have ſomewhat wonder'd as well as I, to obſerve how great a ſhare of Water goes to the making up of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bodies, whoſe Diſguiſes promiſe nothing neere ſo much. The Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eeles, though it yielded me ſome Oyle, and Spirit, and Volatile Salt, beſides the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> yet were all theſe ſo diſproportionate to the Phlegm that came from them (and in which at firſt they boyl'd as in a Pot of Water) that they ſeem'd to have bin nothing but coagulated Phlegm, which does likewiſe ſtrangely abound in Vipers, though they are eſteem'd very hot in Operation, and will in a Convenient Aire ſurvive ſome dayes the loſs of their Heads and Hearts, ſo vigorous is their Vivacity. Mans Bloud it ſelf as Spirituous, and as Elaborate a Liquor as 'tis reputed, does ſo abound in Phlegm, that, the other Day, Diſtilling ſome of it on purpoſe to try the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment (as I had formerly done in Deers Bloud) out of about ſeven Ounces and a half of pure Bloud we drew neere ſix Ounces of Phlegm, before any of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105458:73"/>more operative Principles began to ariſe, and Invite us to change the Receiver. And to ſatisfie my ſelf that ſome of theſe Animall Phlegms were void e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Spirit to deſerve that Name, I would not content my ſelf to taſte them only, but fruitleſly pour'd on them acid Liquors, to try if they contain'd any Volatile Salt or Spirit, which (had there been any there) would probably have diſcover'd it ſelf by making an Ebullition with the affuſed Liquor. And now I mention Corroſive Spirits, I am minded to Informe you, That though they ſeem to be nothing elſe but Fluid Salts, yet they abound in Water, as you may Obſerve, if either you Entangle, and ſo Fix their Saline Part, by making them Corrode ſome idoneous Body, or elſe if you mortifie it with a contrary Salt; as I have very manifeſtly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the making a Medecine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Balſamus Samech,</hi> with Diſtill'd Vinager inſtead of Spirit of Wine, wherewith he prepares it: For you would ſcarce Beleeve (what I have lately Obſerv'd) that of that acid Spirit, the Salt of Tartar, from which it is Diſtill'd, will by mortifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105458:74"/>the acid Salt turn into worthleſs Phlegm neere twenty times its weight, before it be ſo fully Impregnated as to rob no more Diſtill'd Vinager of its Salt. And though Spirit of Wine Exquiſitely rectify'd ſeem of all Liquors to be the moſt free from Water, it being ſo Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that it will Flame all away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving the leaſt Drop behinde it, yet even this Fiery Liquor is by <hi>Helmont</hi> not improbably affirm'd, in caſe what he relates be True, to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially Water, under a Sulphureous Diſguiſe: For, according to him, in the making that excellent Medecine, <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> his <hi>Balſamus Samech,</hi> (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Sal Tartari</hi> dulcify'd by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from it Spirit of Wine till the Salt be ſufficiently glutted with its Sulphur, and ſuffer the Liquor to be drawn off, as ſtrong as it was pour'd on) when the Salt of Tartar from which it is Diſtill'd hath retain'd, or depriv'd it of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts of the Spirit of Wine, the reſt, which is incomparably the greater part of the Liquor, will remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate into Phlegm. I added that Clauſe <hi>[In caſe what he Relates be True]</hi> becauſe I have not as yet ſufficiently try'd it my
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105458:74"/>ſelf. But not only ſomething of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment keeps me from thinking it, as many Chymiſts do, abſurd, (though I have, as well as they, in vain try'd it with ordinary Salt of Tartar:) but beſides that <hi>Helmont</hi> often Relates it, and draws Conſequences from it; A Perſon noted for his Soberneſſe and Skill in Spagyrical Preparations, having been askt by me, Whether the Experiment might not be made to ſucceed, if the Salt and Spirit were prepar'd according to a way ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Principles, he affirm'd to me, that he had that way I propos'd made <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Experiment ſucceed very well, without adding any thing to the Salt and Spirit. But our way is neither ſhort nor Eaſie.</p>
                  <p>I have indeed (ſayes <hi>Carneades)</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wonder'd to ſee how much Phlegme may be obtain'd from Bodies by the Fire. But concerning that Phlegme I may anon have Occaſion to note ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which I therefore ſhall not now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate. But to return to the Opinion of <hi>Thales,</hi> and of <hi>Helmont,</hi> I conſider, that ſuppoſing the <hi>Alkahest</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all Bodies into water, yet whether that water, becauſe inſipid, muſt be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105458:75"/>may not groundleſly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For I remember the Candid and Eloquent <hi>Petrus Laurembergius</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Sala's</hi> Aphoriſmes affirmes, that he ſaw an inſipid <hi>Menstruum</hi> that was a powerfull Diſſolvent, and (if my Memory do not much miſ-informe me) could diſſolve Gold. And the water which may be Drawn from Quickſilver without Addition, though it be almoſt Taſtleſs, You will I believe think of a differing Nature from ſimple Water, eſpecially if you Digeſt in it Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Mineralls. To which I ſhall add but this, that this Conſideration may be further extended. For I ſee no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to conceive that the Water men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as the Univerſal Matter, was ſimple and Elementary VVater; ſince though we ſhould Suppoſe it to have been an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated Congeries or Heap conſiſting of a great Variety of Seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Rudiments, and of other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles fit to be ſubdu'd and Faſhion'd by them, it might yet be a Body Fluid like VVater, in caſe the Corpuſcles it was made up of, were by their Creator made ſmall enough, and put into ſuch an
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105458:75"/>actuall Motion as might make them Glide along one another. And as we now ſay, the Sea conſiſts of VVater, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Saline, Terreſtrial, and other Bodies mingl'd with it,) ſuch a Liquor may well enough be called VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe that was the greateſt of the known Bodies whereunto it was like; Though, that a Body may be Fluid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to appear a Liquor, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Corpuſcles of a very differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, You will eaſily believe, if You but expoſe a good Quantity of Vitriol in a ſtrong Veſſel to a Competent Fire. For although it contains both Aqueous, Earthy, Saline, Sulphureous, and Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Corpuſcles, yet the whole Maſs will at firſt be Fluid like water, and boyle like a ſeething pot.</p>
                  <p>I might eaſily (Continues <hi>Carneades)</hi> enlarge my ſelf on ſuch Conſiderations, if I were Now Oblig'd to give You my Judgment of the <hi>Thaleſian,</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montian, Hypotheſis.</hi> But Whether or no we conclude that all things were at firſt Generated of Water, I may Deduce from what I have try'd Concerning the Growth of Vegetables, nouriſh'd with water, all that I now propos'd to my Self
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105458:76"/>or need at preſent to prove, namely that Salt, Spirit, Earth, and ev'n Oyl (though that be thought of all Bodies the moſt oppoſite to Water) may be produc'd out of Water; and conſequently that a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Principle as well as a Peripatetick Element, may (in ſome caſes) be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated anew, or obtain'd from ſuch a parcel of Matter as was not endow'd with the form of ſuch aprinciple or Element before.</p>
                  <p>And having thus, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> Evinc'd that 'tis poſſible that ſuch Subſtances as thoſe that Chymiſts are wont to call their <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> may be Generated, anew: I muſt next Endeavour to make it Probable, that the Operation of the Fire does Actually (ſometimes) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divide Compounded Bodies into ſmal Parts, but Compound thoſe Parts after a new Manner; whence Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ought we Know, there may E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge as well Saline and Sulphureous Subſtances, as Bodies of other Textures. And perhaps it will aſſiſt us in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the Effects of the Operations of the Fire upon other Bodies, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a little, what it does to thoſe Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which being Productions of the Art of Man, We beſt know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105458:76"/>of. You may then be pleas'd to take Notice that though Sope is made up by the Sope-Boylers of Oyle or Greaſe, and Salt, and Water Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently Incorporated together, yet if You expoſe the Maſs they Conſtitute to a Graduall Fire in a Retort, You ſhall then indeed make a Separation, but not of the ſame Subſtances that were United into Sope, but of others of a Diſtant and yet not an Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature, and eſpecially of an Oyle very ſharp and Faetid, and of a very Differing Quality from that which was Employ'd to make the Sope: ſo if you Mingle in a due Proportion, <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> with Quick-Lime, and Diſtill them by Degrees of Fire, You ſhall not Divide the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> from the Quick-Lime, though the one be a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and the other a Fix'd Subſtance, but that which will aſcend will be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit much more Fugitive, Penetrant, and ſtinking, then <hi>Sal Armoniack;</hi> and there will remain with the Quick-Lime all or very near all the Sea Salt that concurr'd to make up the <hi>Sal Armoniack;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Sea Salt I ſhall, to ſatisfie You how well it was United to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105458:77"/>Lime, informe You, that I have by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Fire at length very Vehement, caus'd both the Ingredients to melt in the Retort it ſelf into one Maſs and ſuch Maſſes are apt to Relent in the Moiſt Air. If it be here Objected, that theſe Inſtances are taken from factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Concretes which are more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded then thoſe which Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces; I ſhall reply, that beſides that I have Mention'd them as much to Illuſtrate what I propos'd, as to prove it, it will be Difficult to Evince that Nature her ſelf does not make Decompound Bodies, I mean mingle together ſuch mixt Bodies as are already Compounded of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, or rather of more ſimple ones. For Vitriol (for Inſtance) though I have ſometimes taken it out of Minerall Earths, where Nature had without any aſſiſtance of Art prepar'd it to my Hand, is really, though Chymiſts are pleas'd to reckon it among Salts, a De-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Body Conſiſting (as I ſhall have occaſion to declare anon) of a Terreſtriall Subſtance, of a Metal, and alſo of at leaſt one Saline Body, of a peculiar and not Elementary Nature. And we ſee alſo in Animals, that their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105458:77"/>blood may be compos'd of Divers very Differing Mixt Bodies, ſince we find it obſerv'd that divers Sea-Fowle taſt rank of the Fiſh on which they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily feed; and <hi>Hipocrates</hi> himſelf Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that a Child may be purg'd by the Milke of the Nurſe, if ſhe have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Elaterium;</hi> which argues that the purging Corpuſcles of the Medicament Concurr to make up the Milke of the Nurſe; and that white Liquor is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by Phyſitians ſuppos'd to be but blanch'd and alter'd Blood. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have obſerv'd, not farr from the <hi>Alps,</hi> that at a certain time of the Year the Butter of that Country was very Offenſive to ſtrangers, by reaſon of the rank taſt of a certain Herb, whereon the Cows were then wont plentifully to feed. But (proceeds <hi>Carneades</hi>) to give you Inſtances of another kind, to ſhew that things may be obtain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body that were not Pre-exiſtent in it, let Me Remind You, that from many Vegetables there may without any Addition be Obtain'd Glaſs, a Body, which I preſume You will not ſay was Pre-exiſtent in it, but produc'd by the Fire. To which I ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105458:78"/>add but this one Example more, namely that by a certain Artificial way of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Quickſilver, You may without Addition ſeparate from it at leaſt a 5th. or 4th. part of a clear Liquor, which with an Ordinary Peripatetick would paſs for VVater, and which a Vulgar Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt would not ſcruple to call Phlegme, and which, for ought I have yet ſeen or heard, is not reducible into Mercury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and Conſequently is more then a Diſguiſe of it. Now beſides that divers Chymiſts will not allow Mercury to have any or at leaſt any Conſiderable Quantity of either of the Ignoble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, Earth and VVater; Beſides this, I ſay, the great Ponderouſneſs of Quickſilver makes it very unlikely that it can have ſo much Water in it as may be thus obtain'd from it, ſince Mercury weighs 12 or 14 times as much as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Bulk. Nay for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confirmation of this Argument, I will add this Strange Relation, that two Friends of mine, the one a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and the other a Mathematician, and both of them Perſons of unſuſpected Credit, have Solemnly aſſured me, that after many Tryals they made, to reduce
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105458:78"/>Mercury into Water, in Order to a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall Work, upon Gold (which yet, by the way, I know prov'd Unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull) they did once by divers Coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations reduce a pound of Quickſilver into almoſt a pound of Water, and this without the Addition of any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but only by preſſing the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury by a Skillfully Manag'd Fire in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely contriv'd Veſſels. But of theſe Experiments our Friend (ſayes <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> pointing at the Regiſter of this Dialogue) will perhaps give You a more Particular Account then it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to do: Since what I have now ſaid may ſufficiently evince, that the Fire may ſometimes as well alter Bodies as divide them, and by it we may obtain from a Mixt Body what was not Pre-exiſtent in it. And how are we ſure that in no other Body what we call Phlegme is barely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, not Produc'd by the Action of the Fire: Since ſo many other Mixt Bodies are of a much leſs Conſtant, and more alterable Nature, then Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, by many Tricks it is wont to put upon Chymiſts, and by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I told You of, about an hour
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105458:79"/>ſince, Appears to be. But becauſe I ſhall ere long have Occaſion to reſume into Conſideration the Power of the Fire to produce new Concretes, I ſhall no longer inſiſt on this Argument at preſent; only I muſt mind You, that if You will not dis-believe <hi>Helmonts</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, You muſt confeſs that the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> are neither ingenerable nor incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Subſtances; ſince by his <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>best</hi> ſome of them may be produc'd of Bodies that were before of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; and by the ſame powerfull <hi>Menstruum</hi> all of them may be reduc'd into inſipid Water.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Carneades</hi> was about to paſs on to his Third Conſideration, when <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> being deſirous to hear what he could ſay to clear his ſecond General Conſideration from being repugnant to what he ſeem'd to think the true Theory of Miſtion, prevented him by telling him, I ſomewhat wonder, <hi>Carneades,</hi> that You, who are in ſo many Points un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the Peripatetick Opinion touching the Elements and Mixt Bodies, ſhould alſo ſeem averſe to that Notion touching the manner of Miſtion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chymiſts (though perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105458:79"/>knowing that they do ſo) agree with moſt of the Antient Philoſophers that preceded <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and that for Reaſons ſo conſiderable, that divers Modern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts and Phyſitians, in other things unfavourable enough to the Spagyriſts, do in this caſe ſide with them againſt the common Opinion of the Schools. If you ſhould ask me (continues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) what Reaſons I mean? I ſhould partly by the Writings of <hi>Sennertus</hi> and other learned Men, and partly by my own Thoughts, be ſupply'd with more, then 'twere at preſent proper for me to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt largely on. And therefore I ſhall mention only, and that briefly, three or four. Of theſe, I ſhall take the Firſt from the ſtate of the Controverſie it ſelf, and the genuine Notion of Miſtion, which though much intricated by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I take in ſhort to be this. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> at leaſt as many of his Interpreters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him, and as indeed he Teaches in ſome places, where he profeſſedly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from the Antients, declares Miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſuch a mutual Penetration, and perfect Union of the mingl'd Elements, that there is no Portion of the mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how Minute ſoever, which does not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105458:80"/>contain All, and Every of the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or in which, if you pleaſe, all the Elements are not. And I remember, that he reprehends the Miſtion taught by the Ancients, as too ſleight or groſs, for this Reaſon, that Bodies mixt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> though they appear ſo to humane Eyes, would not appear ſuch to the acute Eyes of a <hi>Lynx,</hi> whoſe perfecter Sight would diſcerne the Elements, if they were no otherwiſe mingled, than as his Predeceſſors would have it, to be but Blended, not United; whereas the Antients, though they did not all Agree about what kind of Bodies were Mixt, yet they did almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly hold, that in a compounded Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, though the <hi>Miſcibilia,</hi> whether Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Principles, or whatever they pleas'd to call them, were aſſociated in ſuch ſmall Parts, and with ſo much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, that there was no ſenſible Part of the Maſs but ſeem'd to be of the ſame Nature with the reſt, and with the whole; Yet as to the Atomes, or other Inſenſible Parcels of Matter, whereof each of the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> conſiſted, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd each of them its own Nature, being but by Appoſition or <hi>Juxta</hi>-Poſition uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105458:80"/>with the reſt into one Bodie. So that although by virtue of this compoſition the mixt Body did perhaps obtain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers new Qualities, yet ſtill the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients that Compounded it, retaining their own Nature, were by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> ſeparable from each other, the minute Parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingag'd from thoſe of a differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and aſſociated with thoſe of their own ſort returning to be again, Fire, Earth, or Water, as they were before they chanc'd to be Ingredients of that <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> This may be explain'd (Continues <hi>Eleutherius,</hi>) by a piece of Cloath made of white and black threds interwoven, wherein though the whole piece appear neither white nor black, but of a reſulting Colour, that is gray, yet each of the white and black threds that compoſe it, remains what it was before, as would appear if the threds were pull'd aſunder, and ſorted each Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour by it ſelf. This (purſues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) being, as I underſtand it, the State of the Controverſie, and the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> after their Maſter Commonly Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that Miſtion is <hi>Miſcibilium alterato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Unio,</hi> that ſeems to comport much
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105458:81"/>better with the Opinion of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, then with that of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſince according to that as the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd Example declares, there is but a <hi>Juxta</hi>-poſition of ſeparable Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, retaining each its own Nature, whereas according to the <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> when what they are pleas'd to call a mixt Body reſults from the Concourſe of the Elements, the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo properly be ſaid to be Alter'd, as Deſtroy'd, ſince there is no Part in the mixt Body, how ſmall ſoever, that can be call'd either Fir, or Air, or Water, or Earth.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed can I well underſtand, how Bodies can be mingl'd other wayes then as I have declar'd, or at leaſt how they can be mingl'd, as our Peripateticks would have it. For whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that if a Drop of Wine be put into ten thouſand Meaſures of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Wine being Overpower'd by ſo Vaſt a Quantity of Water will be turn'd into it, he ſpeaks to my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, very improbably; For though One ſhould add to that Quantity of Water as many Drops of Wine as would a Thouſand times exceed it all,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105458:81"/>yet by his Rule the whole Liquor ſhould not be a <hi>Crama,</hi> a Mixture of Wine and Water, wherein the Wine would be Predominant, but VVater only; Since the Wine being added but by a Drop at a time would ſtill Fall into nothing but VVater, and Conſequently would be turn'd into it. And if this would hold in Metals too, 'twere a rare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for Goldſmiths, and Refiners; For by melting a Maſs of Gold, or Silver, and by but caſting into it Lead or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Grain after Grain, they might at pleaſure, within a reaſonable Compaſs of time, turn what Quantity they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, of the Ignoble into the Noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls. And indeed ſince a Pint of wine, and a pint of water, amount to about a Quart of Liquor, it ſeems manifeſt to ſenſe, that theſe Bodies doe not Totally Penetrate one another, as one would have it; but that each retains its own Dimenſions; and Conſequently, that they are by being Mingl'd only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into minute Bodies, that do but touch one another with their Surfaces, as do the Grains, of VVheat, Rye, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, &amp;c. in a heap of ſeverall ſorts of Corn: And unleſs we ſay, that as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105458:82"/>when one meaſure of wheat, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is Blended with a hundred mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Barley, there happens only a <hi>Juxta</hi>-poſition and Superficial Contact betwixt the Grains of wheat, and as many or thereabouts of the Grains of Barley. So when a Drop of wine is mingl'd with a great deal of water, there is but an Appoſition of ſo many Vinous Corpuſcles to a Correſpondent Number of Aqueous ones; Unleſs I ſay this be ſaid, I ſee not how that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity will be avoyded, whereunto the Stoical Notion of miſtion (namely by <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Confuſion) was Liable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the leaſt Body may be co-extended with the greateſt: Since in a mixt Body wherein before the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were Mingl'd there was, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but one pound of water to ten thouſand of Earth, yet according to them there muſt not be the leaſt part of that Compound, that Conſiſted not as well of Earth, as water. But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, Perhaps, too long (ſayes <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>) upon the proofs afforded me by the Nature of Miſtion: Wherefore I will but name Two or Three other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; whereof the firſt ſhall be,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105458:82"/>that according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelf, the motion of a mixt Body followes the Nature of the Predominant Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as thoſe wherein the Earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, tend towards the Centre of heavy Bodies. And ſince many things make it Evident, that in divers Mixt Bodies the Elementary Qualities are as well Active, though not altogether ſo much ſo as in the Elements themſelves, it ſeems not reaſonable to deny the actual Exiſtence of the Elements in thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wherein they Operate.</p>
                  <p>To which I ſhall add this Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argument, that Experience mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Confeſſes it, that the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> may be again ſeparated from a mixt Body, as is Obvious in the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Reſolutions of Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls, which could not be unleſs they did actually retain their formes in it: For ſince, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and I think according to truth, there is but one common Maſs of all things, which he has been pleas'd to call <hi>Materia Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> And ſince tis not therefore the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but the Forme that Conſtitutes and Diſcriminates Things, to ſay that the Elements remain not in a Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105458:83"/>according to their Formes, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Matter, is not to ſay that they remain there at all; Since although thoſe Portions of Matter were Earth and water, &amp;c. before they concurr'd, yet the reſulting Body being once Conſtituted, may as well be ſaid to be ſimple as any of the Elements, the Matter being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly of the ſame Nature in all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Elementary Formes being according to this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> periſh'd and aboliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, and if we will Conſult Chymical Experiments, we ſhall find the Advantages of the Chymical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine above the Peripatetick Title little leſs then Palpable. For in that Operation that Refiners call Quartation, which they employ to purifie Gold, although three parts of Silver be ſo exquiſitely mingl'd by Fuſion with a fourth Part of Gold (whence the Operation is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated) that the reſulting Maſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſeverall new Qualities, by virtue of the Compoſition, and that there is ſcarce any ſenſible part of it that is not Compos'd of both the metalls; Yet if You caſt this mixture into <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the Silver will be diſſolv'd in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105458:83"/>
                     <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and the Gold like a dark or black Powder will fall to the Bottom of it, and either Body may be again reduc'd into ſuch a Metal as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which ſhews: that it retain'd its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithſtanding its being mixt <hi>per Minima</hi> with the other: We likewiſe ſee, that though one part of pure Silver be mingled with eight or ten Parts, or more, of Lead, yet the Fire will upon the Cuppel eaſily and perfectly ſeparate them again. And that which I would have you peculiarly Conſider on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is, that not only in Chymicall Anatomies there is a Separation made of the Elementary Ingredients, but that ſome Mixt Bodies afford a very much greater Quantity of this or that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Principle than of another; as we ſee, that Turpentine and Amber yield much more Oyl and Sulphur than they do Water, whereas Wine, which is confeſs'd to be a perfectly mixt Bodie, yields but a little Inflamable Spirit, or Sulphur, and not much more Earth; but affords a vaſt proportion of Phlegm or water: which could not be, if as the Peripateticks ſuppoſe, every, even of the minuteſt Particles, were of the ſame
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105458:84"/>nature with the whole, and conſequently did contain both Earth and Water, and Aire, and Fire; Wherefore as to what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> principally, and almoſt only Objects, that unleſs his Opinion be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there would be no true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Miſtion, but onely Aggregates or Heaps of contiguous Corpuſcles, which, though the Eye of Man cannot diſcerne, yet the Eye of a <hi>Lynx</hi> might perceive not to be of the ſame Nature with one another and with their <hi>Totum,</hi> as the Nature of Miſtion requires, if he do not beg the Queſtion, and make Miſtion to conſiſt in what other Naturaliſts deny to be requiſite to it, yet He at leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects That as a great Inconvenience which I cannot take for ſuch, till he have brought as Conſiderable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as I have propos'd to prove the contrary, to evince that Nature makes other Miſtions than ſuch as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, wherein the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into minute Parts, and United as farr as ſenſe can diſcerne: which if You will not grant to be ſufficient for a true Miſtion, he muſt have the ſame Quarrel with Nature her ſelf, as with his Adverſaties.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:105458:84"/>
                  <p>Wherefore (Continues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) I cannot but ſomewhat marvail that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi> ſhould oppoſe the Doctrine of the Chymiſt in a Particular, wherein they do as well agree with his old Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, Nature, as diſſent from his old Adverſary, <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt not (replies <hi>Carneades</hi>) engage my ſelf at preſent to examine thorowly the Controverſies concerning Miſtion: And if there were no third thing, but that I were reduc'd to embrace abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and unreſervedly either the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or that of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that went before him, I ſhould look upon the latter, which the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have adopted, as the more defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Opinion: But becauſe differing in the Opinions about the Elements from both Parties, I think I can take a middle Courſe, and Diſcourſe to you of Miſtion after a way that does neither perfectly agree, nor perfectly diſagree with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I will not peremptorily define, whether there be not Caſes wherein ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Miſtion ſeem to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Opinion that the Chymiſts Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons borrow'd of the Antients, I ſhall only endeavour to ſhew You that there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105458:85"/>are ſome caſes which may keep the Doubt, which makes up my ſecond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſideration from being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall then freely acknowledge to You (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) that I am not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-well ſatisfi'd with the Doctrine that is aſcribed to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> concerning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, eſpecially fince it teaches that the four Elements may again be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the mixt Body; whereas if they continu'd not in it, it would not be ſo much a Separation as a Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And I think the Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that Preceded <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts who have ſince receiv'd the ſame Opinion, do ſpeak of this matter more intelligibly, if not more probably, then the Peripateticks: but though they ſpeak Congruouſly enough, to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that there are a certain Number of Primogeneal Bodies, by whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe all thoſe we call Mixts are Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and which in the Deſtruction of mixt Bodies do barely part company, and recede from one another, juſt ſuch as they were when they came together; yet I, who meet with very few Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I can entirely Acquieſce in,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105458:85"/>muſt confeſs to You that I am inclin'd to differ not only from the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> but from the old Philoſophers and the Chymiſts, about the Nature of Miſtion: And if You will give me leave, I ſhall Briefly propoſe to you my preſent No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, provided you will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, not ſo much as an Aſſertion as an <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> in talking of which I do not now pretend to propoſe and debate the whole Doctrine of Miſtion, but to ſhew that 'tis not Improbable, that ſometimes mingl'd ſubſtances may be ſo ſtrictly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, that it doth not by the uſuall O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Fire, by which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are wont to ſuppoſe themſelves to have made the <hi>Analyſes</hi> of mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſufficiently appear, that in ſuch Bodies the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> that concurr'd to make them up do each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its own peculiar Nature: and by the <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> Fires may be more eaſily extricated and Recover'd, than Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, either by a Change of Texture in the Parts of the ſame Ingredient, or by an Aſſociation with ſome parts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ingredient more ſtrict than was that of the parts of this or that <hi>Miſcibile</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. At theſe words <hi>Eleu.</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:105458:86"/>having preſs'd him to do what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and promis'd to do what he deſir'd;</p>
                  <p>I conſider then (reſumes <hi>Carneades</hi>) that, not to mention thoſe improper Kinds of miſtion, wherein <hi>Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Bodies are Joyn'd, as when Water is mingl'd with water, or two Veſſels full of the ſame kind of Wine with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the miſtion I am now to Diſcourſe of ſeems, Generally ſpeaking, to be but an Union <hi>per Minima</hi> of any two or more Bodies of differing Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as when Aſhes and Sand are Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated into Glaſs or Antimony, and Iron into <hi>Regulus Martis,</hi> or Wine and Water are mingl'd, and Sugar is diſſolv'd in the Mixture. Now in this general notion of Miſtion it does not appear clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that the <hi>Miſcibilia</hi> or Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients do in their ſmall Parts ſo retain their Nature and remain diſtinct in the Compound, that they may thence by the Fire be again taken aſunder: For though I deny not that in ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of certain permanent Bodies this Recovery of the ſame Ingredients may be made, yet I am not convinc'd that it will hold in all or even in moſt, or that it is neceſſarily deducible from Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105458:86"/>Experiments, and the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miſtion. To explain this a little, I aſſume, that Bodies may be mingl'd, and that very durably, that are not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary or reſolv'd into Elements or Principles that they may be mingl'd; as is evident in the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Antimony, and Iron newly mention'd; and in Gold Coyne, which laſts ſo many ages; wherein generally the Gold is alloy'd by the mixture of a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, greater or leſſer, (in our Mints they uſe about a 12th. part) of either ſilver, or Copper, or both. Next, I conſider, that there being but one Univerſal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of things, as 'tis known that the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> themſelves acknowledge, who call it <hi>Materia Prima</hi> (about which nevertheleſs I like not all their Opinions,) the Portions of this matter ſeem to differ from One Another, but in certain Qualities or Accidents, fewer or more; upon whoſe Account the Corporeal Subſtance they belong to receives its Denomination, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to this or that particular ſort of Bodies; ſo that if it come to loſe, or be depriv'd of thoſe Qualities, though it ceaſes not to be a Body, yet it ceaſes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105458:87"/>from being that kind of Body as a Plant, or Animal, or Red, Green, Sweet, Sowre, or the like. I conſider that it very often happens that the ſmall parts of Bodies cohere together but by immediate Contact and Reſt; and that however, there are few Bodies whoſe minute Parts ſtick ſo cloſe together, to what cauſe ſoever their Combination be aſcrib'd, but that it is poſſible to meet with ſome other Body, whoſe ſmall Parts may get between them, and ſo dis-joyn them; or may be fitted to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here more ſtrongly with ſome of them, then thoſe ſome do with the reſt; or at leaſt may be combin'd ſo cloſely with them, as that neither the Fire, nor the other uſual Inſtruments of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Anatomies will ſeparate them. Theſe things being premis'd, I will not peremptorily deny, but that there may be ſome Cluſters of Particules, wherein the Particles are ſo minute, and the Coherence ſo ſtrict, or both, that when Bodies of Differing Denominations, and conſiſting of ſuch durable Cluſters, happen to be mingl'd, though the Compound Body made up of them may be very Differing from either of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105458:87"/>the Ingredients, yet each of the little Maſſes or Cluſters may ſo retain its own Nature, as to be again ſeparable, ſuch as it was before. As when Gold and Silver being melted together in a Due Proportion (for in every Proportion, the Refiners will tell You that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment will not ſucceed) <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will diſſolve the Silver, and leave the Gold untoucht; by which means, as you lately noted, both the Metalls may be recover'd from the mixed Maſs. But (Continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) there are other Cluſters wherein the Particles ſtick not ſo cloſe together, but that they may meet with Corpuſcles of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which are diſpos'd to be more cloſely United with ſome of them, then they were among themſelves. And in ſuch caſe, two thus combining Corpuſcles loſing that Shape, or Size, or Motion, or other Accident, upon whoſe Account they were endow'd with ſuch a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Quality or Nature, each of them really ceaſes to be a Corpuſcle of the ſame Denomination it was before; and from the Coalition of theſe there may emerge a new Body, as really one, as either of the Corpuſcles was before
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105458:88"/>they were mingl'd, or, if you pleaſe, Confounded: Since this Concretion is really endow'd with its own Diſtinct qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and can no more by the Fire, or any other known way of <hi>Analyſis,</hi> be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided again into the Corpuſcles that at firſt concurr'd to make it, than either of them could by the ſame means be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into other Particles. But (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) to make this more intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by particular examples; If you diſſolve Copper in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or Spirit of Nitre, (for I remember not which I us'd, nor do I think it much Material) You may by Cryſtalizing the Solution Obtain a goodly Vitriol; which though by Virtue of the Compoſition it have manifeſtly diverſe Qualities, not to be met with in either of the Ingredients, yet it ſeems that the Nitrous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or at leaſt many of them, may in this Compounded Maſs retain their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Nature; for having for tryal ſake Diſtill'd this Vitrioll Spirit, there came over ſtore of Red Fumes, which by that Colour, by their peculiar ſtinke, and by their Sourneſs, manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, Nitrous Spirits; and that the remaining Calx continu'd Copper,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105458:88"/>I ſuppoſe you'l eaſily beleeve. But if you diſſolve <hi>Minium,</hi> which is but Lead Powder'd by the Fire, in good Spirit of Vinager, and Cryſtalize the Solution, you ſhall not only have a Saccharine Salt exceedingly differing from both its Ingredients; but the Union of ſome Parts of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> with ſome of thoſe of the Metal is ſo ſtrict, that the Spirit of Vinager ſeems to be, as ſuch, deſtroy'd, ſince the Saline Corpuſcles have quite loſt that acidity, upon whoſe Account the Liquor was call'd Spirit of Vinager; nor can any ſuch Acid Parts as were put to the <hi>Minium</hi> be Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by any known way from the <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Saturni</hi> reſulting from them both; for not only there is no Sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all, but an admirable Sweetneſs to be taſted in the Concretion; and not only I found not that Spirit of Wine, which otherwiſe will immediately hiſs when mingl'd with ſtrong Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager, would hiſs being pour'd upon <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> wherein yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salt of Vinager, did it Survive, may ſeem to be concentrated; but upon the Diſtillation of <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> by its Self I found indeed a Liquor very Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrant,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105458:89"/>but not at all Acid, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well in ſmell and other Qualities, as in taſt, from the Spirit of Vinager; which likewiſe ſeem'd to have left ſome of its Parts very firmly united to the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which though of a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Nature was in ſmell, Colour, &amp;c. differing from <hi>Minium;</hi> which brings into my mind, that though two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the one Blew, and the other Yellow, may appear a Green mixture, without either of them loſing its own Colour, as a good Microſcope has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inform'd me; yet having mingl'd <hi>Minium</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> in a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Proportion, and expos'd them in a Glaſs Veſſel to the Fire, the whole Maſs became White, and the Red Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles were deſtroy'd; for though the Calcin'd Lead was ſeparable from the Salt, yet you'l eaſily beleeve it did not part from it in the Forme of a Red Powder, ſuch as was the <hi>Minium,</hi> when it was put to the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> I leave it alſo to be conſider'd, whether in Blood, and divers other Bodies, it be probable, that each of the Corpuſcles that concurr to make a Compound Body doth, though ſome of them in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105458:89"/>ſome Caſes may, retain its own Nature in it, ſo that Chymſts may Extricate each ſort of them from all the others, wherewith it concurr'd to make a Body of one Denomination.</p>
                  <p>I know there may be a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Matter <hi>Immanent,</hi> when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Parts remain and retain their own Nature in the things materiated, as ſome of the Schoolmen ſpeak, (in which ſence Wood, Stones and Lime are the matter of a Houſe,) and <hi>Tranſient,</hi> which in the materiated thing is ſo alter'd, as to receive a new Forme, without being capable of re-admitting again the Old. In which ſence the Friends of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſay, that <hi>Chyle</hi> is the matter of Blood, and Blood that of a Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of all whoſe Parts 'tis preſum'd to be the Aliment. I know alſo that it may be ſaid, that of material Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſome are <hi>common</hi> to all mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as <hi>Aristotles</hi> four Elements, or the Chymiſts <hi>Tria Prima;</hi> others <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar,</hi> which belong to this or that ſort of Bodies; as Butter and a kind of whey may be ſaid to be the Proper Principles of Cream: and I deny not, but that theſe Diſſinctions may in ſome Caſes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105458:90"/>be of Uſe; but partly by what I have ſaid already, and partly by what I am to ſay, You may eaſily enough gueſs in what ſence I admit them, and diſcerne that in ſuch a ſence they will either il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate ſome of my Opinions, or at leaſt will not overthrow any of them.</p>
                  <p>To proſecute then what I was ſaying before, I will add to this purpoſe, That ſince the Major part of Chymiſts Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, what thoſe they call Philoſophers affirme of their Stone, I may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them, that though when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gold and Lead are mingled To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Lead may be ſever'd almoſt un-alter'd from the Gold; yet if inſtead of Gold a <hi>Tantillum</hi> of the Red <hi>Elixir</hi> be mingled with the Saturn, their Union will be ſo indiſſoluble in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Gold that will be produc'd by it, that there is no known, nor perhaps no poſſible way of ſeparating the diffus'd <hi>Elixir</hi> from the fixed Lead, but they both Conſtitute a moſt permanent Body, wherein the Saturne ſeems to have quite loſt its Properties that made it be call'd Lead, and to have been rather tranſmuted by the <hi>Elixir,</hi> then barely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated to it. So that it ſeems not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105458:90"/>neceſſary, that the Bodies that are put together <hi>per minima,</hi> ſhould each retain its own Nature; So as when the Maſs it Self is diſſipated by the Fire, to be more diſpos'd to re-appear in its Priſtine Forme, then in any new one, which by a ſtricter aſſociation of its Parts with thoſe of ſome of the other Ingredients of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> then with one another, it may have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>And if it be objected, that unleſs the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> I oppoſe be admitted, in ſuch Caſes as I have propoſed there would not be an Union but a Deſtruction of mingled Bodies, which ſeems all one as to ſay, that of ſuch Bodies there is no miſtion at all; I anſwer, that <hi>though</hi> the Subſtances that are mingl'd remain, only their Accidents are Deſtroy'd, and <hi>though</hi> we may with tollerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity call them <hi>Miſcibilia,</hi> becauſe they are Diſtinct Bodies before they are put together, however afterwards they are ſo Confounded that I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call them Concretions, or Reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies, than mixt ones; and <hi>though,</hi> perhaps, ſome other and better Account may be propos'd, upon which the name
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105458:91"/>of miſtion may remain; yet if what I have ſaid be thought Reaſon, I ſhall nor wrangle about Words, though I think it fitter to alter a Terme of Art, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a new Truth, becauſe it ſuits not with it. If it be alſo Objected that this Notion of mine, concerning mixtion, though it may be allow'd, when Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies already Compounded are put to be mingl'd, yet it is not applicable to thoſe mixtions that are immediately made of the Elements, or Principles themſelves; I Anſwer in the firſt place, that I here Conſider the Nature of mixtion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more Generally, then the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, who yet cannot deny that there are oftentimes Mixtures, and thoſe very durable ones, made of Bodies that are not Elementary. And in the next place, that though it may be probably pretended that in thoſe Mixtures that are made immediately of the Bodies that are call'd Principles or Elements, the mingl'd Ingredients may better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Nature in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Maſs, and be more eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from thence; yet, beſides that it may be doubted, whether there be any ſuch Primary Bodies, I ſee not why the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105458:91"/>reaſon I alleadg'd, of the deſtructibility of the Ingredients of Bodies in General, may not ſometimes be Applicable to Salt Sulphur or Mercury; 'till it be ſhewn upon what account we are to believe them Priviledged. And however, (if you pleaſe but to recall to mind, to what purpoſe I told you at Firſt, I meant to ſpeak of Miſtion at this Time) you will perhaps allow that what I have hither to Diſcourſed about it may not only give ſome Light to the Nature of it in general (eſpecially when I ſhall have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to Declare to you my thoughts on that ſubject more fully) but may on ſome Occaſions alſo be Serviceable to me in the Inſuing Part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>But, to look back Now to that part of our Diſcourſe, whence this Excurſion concerning Miſtion has ſo long diverted us, though we there Deduc'd, from the differing Subſtances obtained from a Plant nouriſhed only with Water, and from ſome other things, that it was not neceſſary that nature ſhould alwaies compound a Body at firſt of all ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering bodies as the fire could afterwards make it afford; yet this is not all that may be collected from thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105458:92"/>For from them there ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Deducible ſomething that Subverts an other Foundation of the Chymical Doctrine. For ſince that (as we have ſeen) out of fair Water alone, not only Spirit, but Oyle, and Salt, and Earth may be Produced; It will follow that Salt and Sulphur are not Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal Bodies, and principles, ſince they are every Day made out of plain Water by the Texture which the Seed or Seminal principle of plants puts it into. And this would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſeem ſo ſtrange, if through pride, or negligence, We were not Wont to Overlook the Obvious and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Workings of Nature; For if We conſider what ſlight Qualities they are that ſerve to denominate one of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> We ſhall find that Nature do's frequently enough work as great Alterations in divers parcells of matter: For to be readily diſſoluble in water, is enough to make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is ſo, paſſe for a Salt. And yet I ſee not why from a new ſhufling and Diſpoſition of the Component Particles of a body, it ſhould be much harder for Nature to compoſe a body diſſoluble in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105458:92"/>Water, of a portion of Water that was not ſo before, then of the Liquid ſubſtance of an Egg, which will eaſily mix with VVater, to produce by the bare warmth of a hatching Hen, Membrans, Feathrs, Tendons, and other parts, that are not diſſoluble in VVater as that Liquid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was: Nor is the Hardneſs and Brittleneſs of Salt more difficult for Nature to introduce into ſuch a yielding body as VVater, then it is for her to make the Bones of a Chick out of the tender Subſtance of the Liquors of an Egg. But inſtead of proſecuting this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as I eaſily might, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as ſoon as I have taken notice of an objection that lies in my Way. For I eaſily foreſee it will be alledged, that the above mentioned Examples are all taken from Plants, and Animals, in whom the Matter is Faſhioned by the Plaſtick power of the ſeed, or ſomething analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous thereunto. Whereas the Fire do's not act like any of the Seminal Principles, but deſtroyes them all, when they come within its Reach. But to this I ſhall need at preſent to make but this eaſy Anſwer, That whether it be a Seminal Principle, or any other which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105458:93"/>faſhions that Matter after thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners I have mentioned to You, yet 'tis Evident, that either by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick principle Alone, or that and Heat Together, or by ſome Other cauſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to context the matter, it is yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the matter may be Anew contriv'd into ſuch Bodies. And 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Poſſibility of this that I am now contending.</p>

                  <p>WHat I have hitherto Diſcours'd, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (ſayes his Friend to Him) has, I preſume, ſhew'n You, that a Conſidering Man may very well queſtion the Truth of thoſe very Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which Chymiſts as well as Peripatericks, without proving, take for granted; and upon which Depends the Validity of the Inferences they draw from their Experiments. Wherefore having diſpach't that, which though a Chymiſt Perhaps will not, yet I do, look upon as the moſt Important, as well as Difficult, part of my Task, it will now be Seaſonable for me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105458:94"/>to the Conſideration of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments themſelves, wherein they are wont ſo much to Triumph and Glory. And theſe will the rather deſerve a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Examination, becauſe thoſe that Alledge them are wont to do it with ſo much Confidence and Oſtentation, that they have hitherto impos'd upon almoſt all Perſons, without excepting Philoſophers and Phyſitians themſelves; who have read their Books, or heard them talk. For ſome learned Men have been content rather to beleeve what they ſo boldly Affirm, then be at the trouble and charge, to try whether or no it be True. Others again, who have Curioſity enough to Examine the Truth of what is Averr'd, want Skill and Opportunity to do what they Deſire. And the Generality even of Learned Men, ſeeing the Chymiſts (not contenting themſelves with the Schools to amuſe the World with empty words) Actually Perform'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtrange things, and, among thoſe Reſolve Compound Bodies into ſeveral Subſtances not known by former Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers to be contain'd in them: Men I ſay, ſeeing theſe Things, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105458:94"/>Hearing with what Confidence Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Averr the Subſtances Obtain'd from Compound Bodies by the Fire to be the True Elements, or, (as they ſpeak) Hypoſtaticall Principles of them, are forward to think it but Juſt as well as Modeſt, that according to the <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> Rule, the Skilfull <hi>Artists</hi> ſhould be Credited in their own Art; Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thoſe things whoſe Nature they ſo Confidently take upon them to teach others are not only Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own Skill, but ſuch as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Know not elſe what to make of.</p>
                  <p>But though (Continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) the Chymiſts have been able upon ſome or other of the mention'd Acounts, not only to Delight but Amaze, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to bewitch even Learned Men; yet ſuch as You and I, who are not unpractis'd in the Trade, muſt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Selves to be impos'd upon by hard Names, or bold Aſſertions; nor to be dazl'd by that Light which ſhould but aſſiſt us to diſcern things the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is one thing to be able to help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to produce things, and another thing to Underſtand well the Nature
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105458:95"/>of the things produc'd. As we ſee, that many Perſons that can beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are for all that as Ignorant of the Number and Nature of the parts, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the internal ones, that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Childs? Body, as they that never were Parents. Nor do I Doubt, but you'l excuſe me, if as I thank the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts for the things their <hi>Analyſis</hi> ſhews me, ſo I take the Liberty to conſider how many, and what they are, without being aſtoniſh'd at them; as if, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath Skill enough to ſhew men ſome new thing of his own making, had the Right to make them believe whatſoever he pleaſes to tell them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I will now proceed to my Third General Conſideration, which is, That it does not appear, that <hi>Three</hi> is preciſely and Univerſally the Number of the Diſtinct Subſtances or Elements, whereinto mixt Bodies are reſoluble by the Fire; I mean that 'tis not prov'd by Chymiſts, that all the Compound Bodies, which are granted to be perfectly mixt, are upon their Chymical <hi>Analyſis</hi> diviſible each of them into juſt Three Diſtinct Subſtances, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105458:95"/>more nor leſs, which are wont to be lookt upon as Elementary, or may as well be reputed ſo as thoſe that are ſo reputed. Which laſt Clauſe I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne, to prevent your Objecting, that ſome of the Subſtances I may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mention by and by, are not perfectly Homogeneous, nor Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently worthy of the name of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For that which I am now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is, into how many Differing Subſtances, that may plauſibly paſs for the Elementary Ingredients of a mix'd Body, it may be Analyz'd by the Fire; but whether each of theſe be un-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, I reſerve to examine, when I ſhall come to the next General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; where I hope to evince, that the Subſtances which the Chymiſts not only allow, but aſſert to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent Principles of the Body reſolv'd into them, are not wont to be uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two Kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (purſues <hi>Carneades</hi>) which may be brought to make my Third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſeem probable; one ſort of them being of a more Speculative Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the other drawn from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105458:96"/>To begin then with the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>But as <hi>Carneades</hi> was going to do as he had ſaid, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> interrupted him, by ſaying with a ſomewhat ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;</p>
                  <p>If you have no mind I ſhould think, that the Proverb, <hi>That Good Wits have bad Memories,</hi> is Rational and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to You, You muſt not Forget now you are upon the Speculative Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that may relate to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elements; that your Self did not long ſince Deliver and Concede ſome Propoſitions in Favour of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Doctrine, which I may without diſparagement to you think it uneaſie, even for <hi>Carneades</hi> to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I have not, replies he, Forgot the Conceſſions you mean; but I hope too, that you have not forgot neither with what Cautions they were made, when I had not yet aſſumed the Perſon I am now ſuſtaining. But however, I ſhall to content You, ſo diſcourſe of my Third general conſideration, as to let You ſee, That I am not Unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the things you would have me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:105458:96"/>
                  <p>To talk then again according to ſuch principles as I then made uſe of, I ſhall repreſent, that if it be granted rational to ſuppoſe, as I then did, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſted at firſt of certain ſmall and primary Coalitions of the minute Particles of matter into Corpuſcles ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous, and very like each other, It will not be abſurd to conceive, that ſuch primary Cluſters may be of far more ſorts then three or five; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we need not ſuppoſe, that in each of the compound Bodies we are treating of there ſhould be found juſt three ſorts of ſuch primitive Coalitions, as we are ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>And if according to this Notion we allow a conſiderable number of differing Elements, I may add, that it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible, that to the conſtitution of one ſort of mixt Bodies two kinds of Elementary ones may ſuffice (as I lately Exemplify'd to you, in that moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Concrete, Glaſs,) another ſort of Mixts may be compos'd of three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, another of four, another of five, and another perhaps of many more. So that according to this Notion, there can be no determinate number aſſign'd, as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105458:97"/>that of the Elements, of all ſorts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies whatſoever, it being very probable that ſome Concretes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of fewer, ſome of more Elements. Nay, it does not ſeem Impoſſible, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe Principles, but that there may be two ſorts of Mixts, whereof the one may not have any of all the ſame Elements as the other conſiſts of; as we oftentimes ſee two words, whereof the one has not any one of the Letters to be met with in the other; or as we often meet with diverſe Electuaries, in which no Ingredient (except Sugar) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to any two of them. I will not here debate whether there may not be a multitude of theſe Corpuſcles, which by reaſon of their being primary and ſimple, might be called Elementary, if ſeveral ſorts of them ſhould convene to compoſe any Body, which are as yet free, and neither as yet contex'd and entangl'd with primary Corpuſcles of other kinds, but remains liable to be ſubdu'd and faſhion'd by Seminal Principles, or the like powerful and Tranſmuting Agent, by whom they may be ſo connected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, or with the parts of one of the bodies, as to make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105458:97"/>Bodies, whoſe Ingredients they are, reſoluble into more, or other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then thoſe that Chymiſts have hitherto taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>To all which I may add, that ſince it appears, by what I obſerv'd to you of the permanency of Gold and Silver, that even Corpuſcles that are not of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary but compounded Nature, may be of ſo durable a Texture, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main indiſſoluble in the ordinary <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> that Chymiſts make of Bodies by the Fire; 'Tis not impoſſible but that, though there were but three Elements, yet there may be a greater number of Bodies, which the wonted wayes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy will not diſcover to be no Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bodies.</p>
                  <p>But, ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> having thus far, in compliance to you, talk't conjectural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the number of the Elements, 'tis now time to conſider, not of how many Elements it is poſſible that Nature may compound mix'd Bodies, but (at leaſt as farr as the ordinary Experiments of Chymiſts will informe us) of how many ſhe doth make them up.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, that it does not by theſe ſufficiently appear to me, that there is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105458:98"/>any one determinate number of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be uniformly met with in all the ſeveral ſorts of Bodies allow'd to be perfectly mixt.</p>
                  <p>And for the more diſtinct proof of this Propoſition, I ſhall in the firſt place Reprelent, That there are divers Bodies, which I could never ſee by fire divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many as three Elementary ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I would fain (as I ſaid lately to <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponus</hi>) ſee that fixt and noble Metal we call Gold ſeparated into Sait, Sulphur and Mercury: and if any man will ſubmit to a comperent forfeiture in caſe of ſailing, I ſhall willingly in caſe of proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe pay both for the Materials and the charges of ſuch an Experiment. 'Tis not, that after what I have try'd my ſelf I dare peremptorily deny, that there may out of Gold be extracted a certain ſubſtance, which I cannot hinder Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts from calling its Tincture or Sulphur; and which leaves the remaining Body depriv'd of its wonted colour. Nor an I ſure, that there cannot be drawn out of the ſame Metal a real quick and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mercury. But for the Salt of Gold, I never could either ſee it, or be ſatisfied that there was ever ſuch a thing ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105458:98"/>
                     <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> by the relation of any credible eye witneſſe. And for the ſeveral Proceſſes that Promiſe that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the materials that muſt be wrought upon are ſomewhat too pretious and coſtly to be waſted upon ſo groundleſſe adventures, of which not only the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is doubtful, but the very poſſibility is not yet demonſtrated. Yet that which moſt deterres me from ſuch tryalls, is not their chargeableneſſe, but their unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorineſſe, though they ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. For the Extraction of this golden Salt being in Chymiſts Proceſſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be effected by corroſive <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> or the Intervention of other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Bodies, it will remain doubtful to a wary perſon, whether the Emergent Salt be that of the Gold it ſelf; or of the Saline Bodies or Spirits employ'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it; For that ſuch diſguiſes of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals do often impoſe upon Artiſts, I am ſure <hi>Eleutherius</hi> is not ſo much a ſtranger to Chymiſtry as to ignore. I would likewiſe willingly ſee the three principles ſeparated from the pure ſort of Virgin-Sand, from <hi>Qſteocolla,</hi> from refined Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from Quickſilver, freed from its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Sulphur, from <hi>Venetian</hi> Talk,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105458:99"/>which by long detention in an extreme <hi>Reverberium,</hi> I could but divide into ſmaller Particles, (not the conſtituent principles,) Nay, which, when I cauſed it to be kept, I know not how long, in a Glaſſe-houſe fire, came out in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure it's Lumps had when put in, though alter'd to an almoſt <hi>Amethyſtine</hi> colour; and from divers other Bodies, which it were now unneceſſary to enumerate. For though I dare not abſolutely affirme it to be impoſſible to Analyze theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into their <hi>Tria Prima;</hi> yet becauſe, neither my own Experiments, nor any competent Teſtimony hath hitherto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught me how ſuch an <hi>Analyſis</hi> may be made, or ſatisfy'd me, that it hath been ſo, I muſt take the Liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from believing it, till the Chymiſts prove it, or give us intelligible and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable Proceſſes to performe what they pretend. For whilſt they affect that <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical</hi> obſcurity with which they are wont to puzzle the Readers of their divulg'd Proceſſes concerning the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticall Preparation of Gold or Mercury, they leave wary perſons much unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether or no the differing Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they promiſe to produce, be truly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105458:99"/>the Hypoſtatical Principles, or only ſome intermixtures of the divided Bodies with thoſe employ'd to work upon them, as is Evident in the ſeeming Cryſtalls of Silver, and thoſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; which though by ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſuppoſed to be the Salts of thoſe Metalls, are plainly but mixtures of the Metalline Bodies, with the Saline parts of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or other corroſive Liquors; as is evident by their being reducible into Silver or Quickſilver, as they were before.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but Confeſſe (ſaith <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>) that though Chymiſts may upon probable grounds affirm themſelves A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obtain their <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals and Vegetables, yet I have often wondred that they ſhould ſo confidently pretend alſo to reſolve all Metalline and other Mineral bodies into Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. For 'tis a ſaying almoſt Proverbial, among thoſe Chymiſts themſelves that are accounted Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and our famous Countryman <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> has particularly adopted it; that <hi>Facilius est aurum facere quam deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere.</hi> And I fear, with You, that Gold is not the only Mineral from which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are wont fruitleſsly to attempt the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105458:100"/>ſeparating of their three Principles. I know indeed (continues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) that the Learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> even in that book where he takes not upon him to play the Advocate for the Chymiſts, but the Umpier betwixt them and the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks, expreſſes himſelf roundly, thus; <hi>Salem omnibus ineſſe (mixtis ſcilicet) &amp; ex iis fieri poſſe omnibus in reſolutionibus Chymicis verſatis notiſſimum est.</hi>

                     <hi>Adamas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>omnium factus Lapidum ſolidiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus ac duriſſimus ex arctiſſima videlicet triunt principiorum unione ac Cohaerentia, quae nulla arte ſeparationis in ſolutionem principiorum ſuorum ſpiritualium diſjungi poteſt.</hi> And indeed, purſues <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> I was not only glad, but ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find you inclined to Admit that there may be a Sulphur and a running Mercury drawn from Gold; for unleſſe you do (as your expreſſion ſeem'd to intimate) take the word Sulphur in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looſe ſence, I muſt doubt whether our Chymiſts can ſeparate a Sulphur from Gold: For when I ſaw you make the experiment that I ſuppoſe invited you to ſpeak as you did, I did not judge the golden Tincture to be the true principle of Sulphur extracted from the body, but an aggregate of ſome ſuch highly colour'd parts of the Gold, as a Chymiſt would have called a <hi>Sulphur incombuſtible,</hi> which in plain Engliſh ſeems to be little better man to call it a Sulphur and no Sulphur. And as for Metalline Mercuries, I had
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105458:101"/>not <hi>wondred</hi> at it, though you had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much more ſeverity in ſpeaking of them: For I remember that having once met an old and famous Artiſt, who had long been (and ſtill is) Chymiſt to a great Monarch, the repute he had of a very honeſt man invited me to deſire him to tell me ingenuouſly whether or no, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his many labours, he had ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally extracted a true and running Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of Metalls; to which queſtion he freely replyed, that he had never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated a true Mercury from any Metal; nor had ever ſeen it really done by any man elſe. And though Gold is, of all Metalls, That, whoſe Mercury Chymiſts have moſt endeavoured to extract, and which they do the moſt brag they have extracted; yet the Experienced <hi>Angelus Sala,</hi> in his <hi>Spagyrical</hi> account of the ſeven <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Planets (that is the ſeven metalls) affords us this memorable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, to our preſent purpoſe; <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi> (faies he) <hi>&amp;c. experientia tamen (quam ſtultorum Magiſtrum vocamus) certe Comprobavit, Mercurium auri adeo fixum, maturum, &amp; arcte cum reliquis ejuſdem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris ſubſtantiis conjungi, ut nullo modo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogredi poſſit.</hi> To which he ſub-joynes,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105458:101"/>that he himſelf had ſeen much Labour ſpent upon that Deſign, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any ſuch Mercury produc'd thereby. And I eaſily beleeve what he annexes; <hi>that he had often ſeen Detected many tricks and Impostures of Cheating</hi> Alchymiſts. For, the moſt part of thoſe that are fond of ſuch <hi>Charlatans,</hi> being unskilfull or Credulous, or both, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie for ſuch as have ſome Skill, much craft, more boldneſs, and no Conſcience, to impoſe upon them; and therefore, though many profeſs'd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists,</hi> and divers Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have told me that they have made or ſeen the Mercury of Gold, or of this or that other Metal; yet I have been ſtill apt to fear that either theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have had a Deſign to deceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or have not had Skill and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection enough to keep themſelves from being deceived.</p>
                  <p>You recall to my mind (ſayes <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>) a certain Experiment I once devis'd, innocently to deceive ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and let them and others ſee how little is to be built upon the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that are either unskillfull or unwary, when they tell us they have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105458:102"/>ſeen <hi>Alchymists</hi> make the Mercury of this or that Metal; and to make this the more evident, I made my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more Slight, Short and Simple, than the Chymiſts uſuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to Extract Metalline Mercuries; which Operations being commonly more Elaborate and Intricate, and requiring a much more longer time, give the <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> a greater opportunity to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and Conſequently are more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Spectators ſuſpicion. And that wherein I endeavour'd to make my Experiment look the more like a True <hi>Analyſis,</hi> was, that I not only pretended as well as others to extract a Mercury from the Metal I wrought upon, but likewiſe to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a large proportion of manifeſt and inflamable Sulphur. I take then, of the filings of Copper, about a Drachme or two, of common ſublimate, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, the like Weight, and <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> near about as much as of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; theſe three being well mingl'd together I put into a ſmall Vial with a long neck, or, which I find better, into a Glaſs Urinall, which (having firſt ſtopped it with Cotton) to avoid
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105458:102"/>the Noxious Fumes, I approach by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a competent Fire of well kindled coals, or (which looks better, but more endangers the Glaſs) to the Flame of a candle; and after a while the bottom of the Glaſs being held Juſt upon the Kindled Coals, or in the flame, You may in about a quarter of an Hour, or perchance in halfe that time, perceive in the Bottom of the Glaſs ſome running Mercury; and if then You take away the Glaſs and break it, You ſhall find a Parcel of Quickſilver, Perhaps altogether, and perhaps part of it in the pores of the Solid Maſs; You ſhall find too, that the remaining Lump being held to the Flame of the Candle will readily burn with a greeniſh Flame, and after a little while (perchance preſently) will in the Air Acquire a Greeniſh Blew, which being the Colour that is aſcrib'd to Copper, when its Body is unlocked, 'Tis eaſie to perſwade Men that this is the True Sulphur of <hi>Venus,</hi> eſpecially ſince not only the Salts may be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd partly to be Flown away, and partly to be Sublim'd to the upper part of the Glaſs, whoſe inſide (will
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105458:103"/>Commonly appear Whitened by them) but the Metal ſeems to be quite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, the Copper no longer appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Metalline Forme, but almoſt in that of a Reſinous Lump; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Caſe is only this, That the Saline parts of the Sublimate, together with the <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> being excited and actuated by the Vehement heat, fall upon the Copper, (which is a Metal they can more eaſily corrode, than ſilver) whereby the ſmall parts of the Mercury being freed from the Salts that kept them aſunder, and being by the heat tumbled up and down after many Occurſions, they Convene into a Conſpicuous Maſs of Liquor; and as for the Salts, ſome of the more Volatile of them Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming to the upper part of the Glaſs, the others Corrode the Copper, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting themſelves with it do ſtrangely alter and Diſguiſe its Metallick Form, and compoſe with it a new kind of Concrete inflamable like Sulphur; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I ſhall not now ſay any thing, ſince I can Referr You to the Diligent Obſervations which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has made concerning this Odde kind of Verdigreaſe. But Continues
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105458:103"/>
                     <hi>Carneades</hi> ſmiling, you know I was not cut out for a Mountebank, and therefore I will haſten to reſume the perſon of a Sceptick, and take up my diſcourſe where You diverted me from proſecuting it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, then, I conſider, that, as there are ſome Bodies which yield not ſo many as the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; ſo there are many others, that in their Reſolution Exhibite more principles than three; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ternary Number is not that of the Univerſal and Adequate Principles of Bodies. If you allow of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I ately made You, touching the primary Aſſociations of the ſmall Particles of matter, You will ſcarce think it improbable, that of ſuch Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Corpuſcles there may be more ſorts then either three, or four, or five. And if you will grant, what will ſcarce be deny'd, that Corpuſcles of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Nature may in all the wonted Examples of Chymiſts paſs for Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, I ſee not, why you ſhould think it impoſſible, that as <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> will make a Separation of colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Silver and Gold, though the Fire cannot; ſo there may be ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105458:104"/>found out ſo ſubtile and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, at leaſt in reſpect of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar compounded Corpuſcles, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſolve them into thoſe more ſimple ones, whereof they conſiſt, and conſequently encreaſe the number of the Diſtinct Subſtances, whereinto the mixt Body has been hitherto thought reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. And if that be true, which I recited to you a while ago out of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> concerning the Operations of the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> which divides Bodies into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtinct Subſtances, both as to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Nature, then the Fire does; it will not a little countenance my Conjecture. But confining our ſelves to ſuch wayes of Analyzing mix'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as are already not unknown to Chymiſts, it may without Abſurdity be Queſtion'd, whether beſides thoſe groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Elements of Bodies, which they call Salt Sulphur and Mercury, there may not be Ingredients of a more Subtile Nature, which being extreamly little, and not being in themſelves Viſible, may eſcape unheeded at the Junctures of the Deſtillatory Veſſels, though never ſo carefully Luted. For let me obſerve to you one thing, which though
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105458:104"/>not taken notice of by Chymiſts, may be a notion of good Uſe in divers Caſes to a Naturaliſt, that we may well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that there may be ſeverall Sorts of Bodies, which are not Immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of any one of our ſenſes; ſince we See, that not only thoſe little Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that iſſue out of the Loadſtone, and perform the Wonders for which it is juſtly admired; But the <hi>Effluviums</hi> of Amber, Jet, and other Electricall Concretes, though by their effects upon the particular Bodies diſpos'd to receive their Action, they ſeem to fall under the Cognizance of our Sight, yet do they not as Electrical immediately Affect any of our ſenſes, as do the bodies, whether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or greater, that we See, Feel, Taſte, &amp;c. But, continues <hi>Carneades,</hi> becauſe you may expect I ſhould, as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts do, conſider only the ſenſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Mixt Bodies, let us now fee, what Experience will, even as to theſe, ſuggeſt to us.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems then queſtionable enough, whether from Grapes variouſly order'd there may not be drawn more diſtinct Subſtances by the help of the Fire, then from moſt other mixt Bodies. For the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105458:105"/>Grapes themſelves being dryed into Rayſins and diſtill'd, will (beſides <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali,</hi> Phlegm, and Earth) yield a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of an Empyreumatical Oyle, and a Spirit of a very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from that of Wine. Alſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermented Juice of Grapes affords other diſtil'd Liquors then Wine doth. The Juice of Grapes after fermentation will yield a <hi>Spiritus Ardens;</hi> which if compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently rectifyed will all burn away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving any thing remaining. The ſame fermented Juice degenerating into Vinager, yields an acid and corroding Spirit. The ſame Juice turn'd up, armes it ſelf with Tartar; out of which may be ſeparated, as out of other Bodies, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth: not to mention what Subſtances may be drawn from the Vine it ſelf, probably differing from thoſe which are ſeparated from Tartar, which is a body by it ſelf, that has few reſemblers in the World. And I will further conſider that what force ſoever you will allow this inſtance, to evince that there are ſome Bodies that yield more Elements then others, it can ſcarce be deny'd but that the Major part of bodies that are diviſible into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105458:105"/>yield more then three. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which the Chymiſts are pleaſed to name Hypoſtatical, moſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies contain two others, Phlegme and Earth, which concurring as well as the reſt to the conſtitution of Mixts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as generally, if not more, found in their <hi>Analyſis,</hi> I ſee no ſufficient cauſe why they ſhould be excluded from the number of Elements. Nor will it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to object, as the <hi>Paracelſians</hi> are wont to do, that the <hi>Tria prima</hi> are the moſt uſeful Elements, and the Earth and Water but worthleſſe and unactive; for Elements being call'd ſo in relation to the conſtituting of mixt Bodies, it ſhould be upon the account of its Ingrediency, not of its uſe, that any thing ſhould be affirmed or denyed to be an Element: and as for the pretended uſeleſsneſs of Earth and Water, it would be conſider'd that uſefulneſſe, or the want of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes only a Reſpect or Relation to us; and therefore the preſence, or abſence of it, alters not the Intrinſick nature of the thing. The hurtful Teeth of Vipers are for ought I know uſeleſs to us, and yet are not to be deny'd to be parts of their Bodies; and it were hard to ſhew of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105458:106"/>what greater Uſe to Us, then Phlegme and Earth, are thoſe Undiſcern'd Stars, which our New <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> diſcover to Us, in many Blanched places of the Sky; and yet we cannot but acknowledge them Conſtituent and Conſiderably great parts of the Univerſe. Beſides that whether or no the Phlegme and Earth be immediately Uſeful, but neceſſary to conſtitute the Body whence they are ſeparated; and conſequently, if the mixt Body be not Uſeleſs to us, thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts, without which it could not have been That mixt Body, may be ſaid not to be Unuſeful to Us: and though the Earth and Water be not ſo conſpicuouſly Operative (after ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) as the other three more active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet in this caſe it will not be amiſs to remember the lucky Fable of <hi>Menemius Aggrippa,</hi> of the dangerous Sedition of the Hands and Legs, and other more buſie parts of the Body, againſt the ſeemingly unactive Stomack. And to this caſe alſo we may not unfitly apply that Reaſoning of an Apoſtle, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe; <hi>If the Ear ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Eye, I am not of the Body; Is it therefore not of the Body? If the whole
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105458:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>Body were Eye, where were the Hearing? If the whole were for hearing, where the ſmelling?</hi> In a word, ſince Earth and water appear, as clearly and as generally as the other Principles upon the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bodies, to be the Ingredients where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are made up; and fince they are uſeful, if not immediately to us, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Phyſitians, to the Bodies they conſtitute, and ſo though in ſomewhat a remoter way, are ſerviceable to us; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them out of the number of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not to imitate Nature.</p>
                  <p>But, purſues <hi>Carneades,</hi> though I think it Evident, that Earth and Phlegme are to be reckon'd among the Elements of moſt Animal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Bodies, yet 'tis not upon that Account alone, that I think divers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reſoluble into more Subſtances then three. For there are two Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I have ſometimes made to ſhew, that at leaſt ſome Mixts are diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into more Diſtinct Subſtances then five. The one of theſe Experiments, though 'twill be more ſeaſonable for me to mention it fully anon, yet in the mean time, I ſhall tell you thus much of it, That out of two Diſtill'd Liquors,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105458:107"/>which paſs for Elements of the Bodies whence they are drawn, I can without Addition make a true Yellow and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable Sulphur, notwithſtanding that the two Liquors remain afterwards Diſtinct. Of the other Experiment, which perhaps will not be altogether unworthy your Notice, I muſt now give you this particular Account. I had long obſerv'd, that by the Deſtillation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Woods, both in Ordinary, and ſome unuſuall ſorts of Veſſels, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Spirit that came over, had beſides a ſtrong taſt, to be mot with in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreumaticall Spirits of many other Bodies, an Acidity almoſt like that of Vinager: Wherefore I ſuſpected, that though the ſowriſh Liquor Diſtill'd, for Inſtance, from Box-Wood, be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chymiſts as barely the Spirit of it, and therefore as one ſingle Element or Principle; yet it does really conſiſt of two Differing Subſtances, and may be diviſible into them; and conſequently, that ſuch Woods and other Mixts as abound with ſuch a Vinager, may be ſaid to conſiſt of one Element or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, more then the Chymiſts as yet are Aware of; Wherefore bethinking
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105458:107"/>my ſelf, how the ſeparation of theſe two Spirits might be made, I Quickly found, that there were ſeveral wayes of Compaſſing it. But that of them which I ſhall at preſent mention, was this, Having Deſtill'd a Quantity of Box-Wood <hi>per ſe,</hi> and ſlowly rectify'd the ſowriſh Spirit, the better to free it both from Oyle and Phlegme, I caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Rectify'd Liquor a convenient Quantity of Powder'd Coral, expecting that the Acid part of the Liquor would Corrode the Coral, and being aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it would be ſo retain'd by it, that the other part of the Liquor, which was not of an acid Nature, nor fit to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon the Corals, would be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſcend alone. Nor was I deceiv'd in my Expectation; For having gently abſtracted the Liquor from the Coralls; there came over a Spirit of a Strong ſmell, and of a taſt very piercing, but without any ſourneſs; and which was in diverſe qualities manifeſtly different, not only from a Spirit of Vinager, but from ſome Spirit of the ſame Wood, that I purpoſely kept by me without depriving it of its acid Ingredient. And to ſatisfy you, that theſe two Subſtances were of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105458:108"/>a very differing Nature, I might informe you of ſeveral Tryals that I made, but muſt not name ſome of them, becauſe I cannot do ſo without making ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable diſcoveries. Yet this I ſhall tell you at preſent, that the ſowre Spirit of <hi>Box,</hi> not only would, as I juſt now related, diſſolve Corals, which the other would not faſten on, but being pour'd upon Salt of Tartar would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately boile and hiſs, whereas the other would lye quietly upon it. The acid Spirit pour'd upon <hi>Minium</hi> made a Sugar of Lead, which I did not find the other to do; ſome drops of this penetrant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being mingl'd with ſome drops of the blew Syrup of Violets ſeem'd rather to dilute then otherwiſe alter the colour; whereas the Acid Spirit turn'd the ſurup of a reddiſh colour, and would probably have made it of as pure a red as Acid Salts are wont to do, had not its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been hindered by the mixture of the other Spirit. A few drops of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Spirit being Shaken into a pretty quantity of the infuſion of <hi>Lignum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticum,</hi> preſently deſtroyed all the blewiſh colour, whereas the other Spirit would not take it away. To all which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105458:108"/>it might be added, that having for tryals ſake pour'd fair water upon the Corals that remained in the bottom of the glaſs wherein I had rectifyed the double ſpirit (if I may ſo call it) that was firſt drawn from the Box, I found according to my expectation that the Acid Spirit had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſſolved the Corals, and had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated with them. For by the affuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fair Water, I Obtain'd a Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which (to note that ſingularity upon the bye) was red, whence the Water being evaporated, there remained a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſtance much like the Ordinary Salt of Coral, as Chymiſts are pleas'd to call that Magiſtery of Corals, which they make by diſſolving them in common ſpirit of Vinager, and abſtracting the <hi>Menſtruum ad Siccitatem.</hi> I know not whether I ſhould ſubjoine, on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the ſimple ſpirit of Box, if Chymiſts will have it therefore Saline becauſe it has a ſtrong taſt, will furniſh us with a new kind of Saline Bodies, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from thoſe hitherto taken notice of. For whereas of the three chief ſorts of Salts, the Acid, the Alcalizate, and the Sulphureous, there is none that ſeems to be friends with both the other
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105458:109"/>two, as I may, e're it be long, have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew; I did not find but that the ſimple ſpirit of Box did agree very well (at leaſt as farr as I had occaſion to try it) both with the Acid and the other Salts. For though it would lye very quiet with ſalt of Tartar, Spirit of Urine, or other bodies, whoſe Salts were either of an Alcalizate or fugitive Nature; yet did not the mingling of Oyle of Vitriol it ſelf produce any hiſſing or Efferveſcence, which you know is wont to enſue upon the Affuſion of that highly Acid Liquor upon eit her of the Bodies newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>I think my ſelf, ſayes <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to you, for this Experiment; not only becauſe I forſee you will make it helpful to you in the Enquiry you are now upon, but becauſe it teaches us a Method, whereby we may prepare a numerous ſort of new ſpirits, which though more ſimple then any that are thought Elementary, are manifeſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with peculiar and powerfull qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſome of which may probably be of conſiderable uſe in Phyſick, as well alone, as aſſociated with other things; as one may hopefully gueſs by the redneſs of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105458:109"/>that Solution your ſour Spirit made of Corals, and by ſome other circumſtances of your Narrative. And ſuppoſe (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) that you are not ſo confin'd, for the ſeparation of the Acid parts of theſe compound Spirits from the other, to employ Corals; but that you may as well make uſe of any Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate Salt, or of Pearls, or Crabs eyes, or any other Body, upon which common Spirit of Vinager will eaſily work, and, to ſpeak in an <hi>Helmontian</hi> Phraſe, Exant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet tryed, ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> of what uſe the mention'd liquors may be in Phyſick, either as Medicines or as <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums:</hi> But I could mention now (and may another time) divers of the tryals that I made to ſatisfy my ſelf of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence of theſe two Liquors. But that, as I allow you thinking what you newly told me about Corals, I preſume you will allow me, from what I have ſaid already, to deduce this Corollary; That there are divers compound bodies, which may be reſolv'd into four ſuch differing Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as may as well merit the name of Principles, as thoſe to which the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts freely give it. For ſince they ſcruple
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105458:110"/>not to reckon that which I call the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Spirit of Box, for the ſpirit, or as others would have it, the Mercury of that Wood, I ſee not, why the Acid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and the other, ſhould not each of them, eſpecially that laſt named, be lookt upon as more worthy to be called an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Principle; ſince it muſt needs be of a more ſimple nature then the Liquor, which was found to be diviſible into that, and the Acid Spirit. And this further uſe (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) may be made of our experiment to my preſent purpoſe, that it may give us a riſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that ſince a Liquor reputed by the Chymiſts to be, without diſpute, Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous, is by ſo ſlight a way diviſible into two diſtinct and more ſimple Ingredients, ſome more skilful or happier Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I may find a way either further to divide one of theſe Spirits, or to reſolve ſome or other, if not all, of thoſe other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto paſs'd among Chymiſts for their Elements or Principles.</p>

                  <p>ANd thus much (ſayes <hi>Carneades)</hi> may ſuffice to be ſaid of the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the Diſtinct ſubſtances ſeparable from mixt Bodies by the Fire: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I now proceed to conſider the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of them, and ſhew you, That though they ſeem <hi>Homogeneous</hi> Bodies, yet have they not the purity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that is requiſite to Elements. And I ſhould immediately proceed to the proof of my Aſſertion, but that the Confidence wherewith Chymiſts are wont to call each of the Subſtances we ſpeak of by the name of Sulphur or Mercury, or the other of the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105458:111"/>Principles, and the intollerable Ambiguity they allow themſelves ie their Writings and Expreſſions, makes it neceſſary for me in Order to the Keeping you either from miſtaking me, or thinking I miſtake the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, to take Notice to you and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the unreaſonable Liberty they give themſelves of playing with Names at pleaſure. And indeed if I were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd in this Diſpute, to have ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Phraſeology of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chymiſt, as not to Write any thing which this or that Author may not pretend, not to contradict this or that ſence, which he may give as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerves to his Ambiguous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhould ſcarce know how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, nor which way to turn my ſelf. For I find that even Eminent Writers, (ſuch as <hi>Raymund Lully, Paracelſus</hi> and others) do ſo abuſe the termes they employ, that as they will now and then give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, one name; ſo they will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes give one thing, many Names; and ſome of them (perhaps) ſuch, as do much more properly ſignifie ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Body of another kind; nay even in Technical Words or Termes of Art,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105458:111"/>they refrain not from this Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liberty; but will, as I have Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, call the ſame Subſtance, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Sulphur, and Sometimes the Mercury of a Body. And now I ſpeak of Mercury, I cannot but take Notice, that the Deſcriptions they give us of that Principle or Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of. mixt Bodies, are ſo intricate, that even thoſe that have Endeavour'd to Polliſh and Illuſtrate the Notions of the Chymiſts, are fain to confeſs that they know not what to make of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Ingenuous Acknowledgments, or Deſcriptions that are not Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) I have, in the reading of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chymical Authors, been troubled to find, that ſuch hard Words and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal Expreſſions, as You juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, do even when they treat of Principles, ſeem to be ſtudiouſly affected by thoſe Writers; whether to make themſelves to be admir'd by their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and their Art appear more Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and Myſterious, or, (as they would have us think) to conceal from them a Knowledge themſelves judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:105458:112"/>
                  <p>But whatever (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) theſe Men may promiſe themſelves from a Canting way of delivering the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, they will find the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of Knowing Men ſo vain, as when they underſtand not what they read, to conclude, that it is rather the Writers fault then their own. And thoſe that are ſo ambitious to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by the Vulgar, that rather then go without the Admiration of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant they will expoſe themſelves to the contempt of the Learned, thoſe ſhall, by my conſent, freely enjoy their Option. As for the Myſtical Writers ſcrupling to Communicate their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they might leſs to their own Diſparagement, and to the trouble of their Readers, have conceal'd it by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no Books, then by Writing bad ones. If <hi>Themistius</hi> were here, he would not ſtick to ſay, that Chymiſts write thus darkly, not becauſe they think their Notions too precious to be explain'd, but becauſe they fear that if they were explain'd, men would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that they are farr from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And indeed, I fear that the chief Reaſon why Chymiſts have written ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105458:112"/>obſcurely of their three Principles, may be, That not having Clear and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Notions of them themſelves, they cannot write otherwiſe then Confuſedly of what they but Confuſedly Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: Not to ſay that divers of them, being Conſcious to the Invalidity of their Doctrine, might well enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that they could ſcarce keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being confuted, but by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from being clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. But though much may be ſaid to Excuſe the Chymiſts when they write Darkly, and Aenigmatically, about the Preparation of their <hi>Elixir,</hi> and Some few other grand <hi>Arcana,</hi> the divulging of which they may upon Grounds Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough eſteem unfit; yet when they pretend to teach the General Principles of Natural Philoſophers, this Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Way of Writing is not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd. For in ſuch Speculative Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where the naked Knowledge of the Truth is the thing Principally aim'd at, what does he teach me worth thanks that does not, if he can, make his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intelligible to me, but by Myſtical Termes, and Ambiguous Phraſes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens what he ſhould clear up; and makes
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105458:113"/>me add the Trouble of gueſſing at the ſence of what he Equivocally expreſſes, to that of examining the Truth of what he ſeems to deliver. And if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Philoſophers Stone, and the manner of preparing it, be ſuch Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they would have the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, they may Write Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Clearly of the Principles of mixt Bodies in General, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what they call the Great Work. But for my part (Continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) what my Indignation at this Un-philoſophical way of teaching Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples has now extorted from me, is meant chiefly to excuſe my ſelf, if I ſhall hereafter oppoſe any Particular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion or aſſertion, that ſome Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> or any Eminent Artiſt may pretend not to be his Maſters. For, as I told you long ſince, I am not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to examine private mens writings, (which were a Labour as endleſs as unprofitable) being only engag'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe Opinions about the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> which I find thoſe Chymiſts I have met with to agree in moſt: And I Doubt not but my Arguments againſt their Doctrine will be in great part ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105458:113"/>enough applicable ev'n to thoſe private Opinions, which they do not ſo directly and expreſly oppoſe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that which I am now entering upon being the Conſideration of the things themſelves whereinto <hi>Spagyrists</hi> reſolve mixt Bodies by the Fire, If I can ſhew that theſe are not of an Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature, it will be no great matter what names theſe or thoſe Chymiſts have been pleaſed to give them. And I queſtion not that to a Wiſe man, and conſequently to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it will be leſſe conſiderable to know, what Men Have thought of Things, then what they Should have thought.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth and laſt place, then, I conſider, that as generally as Chymiſts are wont to appeal to Experience, and as confidently as they uſe to inſtance the ſeveral ſubſtances ſeparated by the Fire from a Mixt Body, as a ſufficient proof of their being its component Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Yet thoſe differing Subſtances are many of them farr enough from Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſimplicity, and may be yet look'd upon as mixt Bodies, moſt of them alſo retaining, ſomewhat at leaſt, if not very much, of the Nature of thoſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105458:114"/>Concretes whence they were forc'd.</p>
                  <p>I am glad (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) to ſee the Vanity or Envy of the canting Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts thus diſcover'd and chaſtis'd; and I could wiſh, that Learned Men would conſpire together to make theſe deluding Writers ſenſible, that they muſt no longe hope with Impunity to abuſe the World. For whilſt ſuch Men are quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted to publiſh Books with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Titles, and therein to Aſſert what they pleaſe, and contradict others, and ev'n themſelves as they pleaſe, with as little danger of being confuted as of being underſtood, they are encourag'd to get themſelves a name, at the coſt of the Readers, by finding that intelligent Men are wont for the reaſon newly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, to let their Books and Them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: And the ignorant and credulous (of which the number is ſtill much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of the other) are forward to admire moſt what they leaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. But if Judicious men skill'd in Chymical affaires ſhall once agree to write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby keep men from being ſtunn'd, as it were, or imposd upon by dark or empty Words; 'tis to be hop'd that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105458:114"/>theſe men finding that they can no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er write impertinently and abſurdly, without being laugh'd at for doing ſo, will be reduc'd either to write nothing, or Books that may teach us ſomething, and not rob men, as formerly, of invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time; and ſo ceaſing to trouble the World with Riddles or Impertinencies, we ſhall either by their Books receive an Advantage, or by their ſilence eſcape an Inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>But after all this is ſaid (continues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) it may be repreſented in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Chymiſts, that, in one regard the Liberty they take in uſing names, if it be excuſable at any time, may be more ſo when they ſpeak of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereinto their <hi>Analyſis</hi> reſolves mixt Bodies: Since as Parents have the Right to name their own Children, it has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been allow'd to the Authors of new Inventions, to Impoſe Names upon them. And therefore the ſubjects we ſpeak of being ſo the Productions of the Chymiſt's Art, as not to be otherwiſe, but by it, obtainable; it ſeems but equitable to give the Artiſts leave to name them as they pleaſe: conſidering alſo that none are ſo fit and likely to teach us what thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105458:115"/>are, as they to whom we ow'd them.</p>
                  <p>I told You already (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) that there is great Difference betwixt the being able to make Experiments, and the being able to give a Philoſophical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. And I will not now add, that many a Mine-digger may meet, whilſt he follows his work, with a Gemm or a Mineral which he knowes not what to make of, till he ſhews it a Jeweller or a Mineraliſt to be inform'd what it is. But that which I would rather have here obſerv'd, is, That the Chymiſts I am now in debate with have given up the Liberty You challeng'd for them, of uſing Names at Pleaſure, and confin'd Themſelves by their Deſcriptions, though but ſuch as they are, of their Principles; ſo that although they might freely have call'd any thing their <hi>Analyſis</hi> preſents them with, either Sulphur, or Mercury, or Gas, or Blas, or what they pleas'd; yet when they have told me that Sulphur (for inſtance) is a Primogeneal and ſimple Body, Inflamable, Odorous, &amp;c. they muſt give me leave to diſ-believe them, if they tell me that a Body that is either compounded or uninflamable is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105458:115"/>ſuch a Sulphur; and to think they play with words, when they teach that Gold and ſome other Minerals abound with an Incombuſtible Sulphur, which is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an Expreſſion, as a Sun-ſhine Night, or Fluid Ice.</p>
                  <p>But before I deſcend to the Mention of Particulars belonging to my Fourth Conſideration, I think it convenient to premiſe a few Generals; ſome of which I ſhall the leſs need to inſiſt on at preſent, becauſe I have Touched on them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I muſt invite you to take notice of a certain paſſage in <hi>Helmont;</hi>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105458:116"/>drawn <hi>per ſe</hi> is (as I have try'd) of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp and fretting Quality, and of an odious taſt, He tells us that Simple oyle being only digeſted with <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s <hi>ſal circulatum,</hi> is reduc'd into diſſimilar parts, and yields a ſweet Oyle, very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the oylediſtill'd, from ſallet oyle; as alſo that by the ſame way there may be ſeparated from Wine a very ſweet and gentle Spirit, partaking of a far other and nobler quality then that which is immediately drawn by diſtillation and call'd <hi>Dephlegm'd Aqua vitae,</hi> from whoſe Acrimony this other ſpirit is exceedingly remote, although the <hi>ſal circulatum</hi> that makes theſe <hi>Anatomies</hi> be ſeparated from the Analyz'd Bodies, in the ſame weight and with the ſame qualities it had before; which Affirmation of <hi>Helmont</hi> if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be true, we muſt acknowledge that there may be a very great diſparity betwixt bodies of the ſame denomination (as ſeveral oyles, or ſeveral ſpirits) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from compound Bodies: For, beſides the differences I ſhall anon take notice of, betwixt thoſe diſtill'd Oyles that are commonly known to Chymiſts, it appears by this, that by means of the <hi>Sal Circulatum,</hi> There may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105458:116"/>be quite another ſort of Oyles obtain'd from the ſame Body; and who knowes but that there may be yet other Agents found in Nature, by whoſe help there may, whether by Tranſmutation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, be obtain'd from the Bodies Vulgarly call'd Mixt, Oyles or other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Differing from thoſe of the ſame Denomination, known either to Vulgar Chymiſts, or even to <hi>Helmont</hi> Himſelf: but for fear You ſhould tell me, that this is but a conjecture groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon another Man's Relation, whoſe Truth we have not the means to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will not Inſiſt upon it; but leaving You to Conſider of it at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I ſhall proceed to what is next.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then if that be True which was the Opinion of <hi>Lucippus, Democritus,</hi> and other prime <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> of old, and is in our dayes reviv'd by no mean Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; namely, That our Culinary Fire, ſuch as Chymiſts uſe, conſiſts of ſwarmes of little Bodies ſwiftly moving, which by their ſmallneſs and motion are able to permeate the ſollideſt and Compacteſt Bodies, and even Glaſs it Self; If this (I ſay) be True, ſince we ſee that In flints and other Concretes,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105458:117"/>the Fiery part is Incorporated with the Groſſer, it will not be Irrationall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that multitudes of theſe Fiery Corpuſcles, getting in at the Pores of the Glaſs, may aſſociate themſelves with the parts of the mixt Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they work, and with them Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute new Kinds of Compound Bodies, according as the Shape, Size, and other Affections of the Parts of the Diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Body happen to diſpoſe them, in Reference to ſuch Combinations; of which alſo there may be the greater Number; if it be likewiſe granted that the Corpuſcles of the Fire, though all exceeding minute, and very ſwiftly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are not all of the ſame bigneſs, nor Figure. And if I had not Weightier Conſiderations to Diſcourſe to you of, I could name to you, to Countenance what I have newly ſaid, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Experiments by which I have been Deduc'd to think, that the Particles of an open Fire working upon ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may really Aſſociate themſelves therewith, and add to the Quantity. But becauſe I am not ſo ſure, that when the Fire works upon Bodies included in Glaſſes, it does it by a reall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105458:117"/>of the Fiery Corpuſcles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, through the Subſtance of the Glaſs, I will proceed to what is next to be mention'd.</p>
                  <p>I could (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) help you to ſome Proofes, whereby I think it may be made very probable, that when the Fire acts immediately upon a Body, ſome of its Corpuſcles may ſtick to thoſe of the burnt Body, as they ſeem to do in Quicklime, but in greater numbers, and more permanently. But for fear of retarding Your Progreſs, I ſhall deſire you to deferr this Enquiry till another time, and proceed as you intended.</p>
                  <p>You may then in the next place (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) obſerve with me, that not only there are ſome Bodies, as Gold, and Silver, which do not by the uſual Examens, made by Fire, Diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be mixt; but if (as You may Remember I formerly told You) it be a De-compound Body that is Diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ſeveral Subſtances, by being expos'd to the Fire it may be reſolv'd into ſuch a; are neither Elementary, nor ſuch as it was upon its laſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Compounded of; but into new
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105458:118"/>Kinds of mixts. Of this I have already given You ſome Examples in Sope, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Lead, and Vitrioll. Now if we ſhall Conſider that there are ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well Natural, (as that I laſt nam'd) as Factitious, manifeſtly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded; That in the Bowells of the Earth Nature may, as we ſee ſhe ſometimes does, make ſtrange Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; That Animals are nouriſh'd with other Animals and Plants; And, that theſe themſelves have almoſt all of them their Nutriment and Growth, <hi>either</hi> from a certain Nitrous Juice Harbour'd in the Pores of the Earth, or from the Excrements of Animalls, <hi>or</hi> from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd Bodies, either of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Vegetables, <hi>or</hi> from other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a Compounded Nature; If, I ſay, we conſider this, it may ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that there may be among the Works of Nature (not to mention thoſe of Art) a greater Number of De-compound Bodies, then men take Notice of; And indeed, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alſo obſerv'd, it does not at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all Mixtures muſt be of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bodies; but it ſeems farr more probable, that there are divers ſorts of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:105458:118"/>compound Bodies, even in regard of all or ſome of their Ingredients, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd Antecedently to their Mixture. For though ſome ſeem to be made up by the immediate Coalitions of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, or Principles themſelves, and therefore may be call'd <hi>Prima Mista,</hi> or <hi>Miſta Primaria;</hi> yet it ſeems that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies are mingl'd (if I may ſo ſpeak) at the ſecond hand, their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ingredients being not Elementary, but theſe primary Mixts newly ſpoken of; And from divers of theſe Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſort of Mixts may reſult, by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Compoſition, a Third ſort, and ſo onwards. Nor is it improbable, that ſome Bodies are made up of Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not all of the ſame Order, but of ſeveral; as (for Inſtance) a Concrete may conſiſt of Ingredients, whereof the one may have been a primary, the other a Secondary Mixt Body; (as I have in Native Cinnaber, by my way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it, found both that Courſer the part that ſeems more properly to be Oar, and a Combuſtible Sulphur, and a Running Mercury:) or perhaps without any Ingredient of this latter ſort, it may be compos'd of Mixt Bodies, ſome of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105458:119"/>them of the firſt, and ſome of the third Kind; And this may perhaps be somewhat Illustrated by reflecting upon what happens in ſome Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of thoſe Medicines which they call their <hi>Bezoardicum's.</hi> For firſt, they take Antimony and Iron, which may be look'd upon as <hi>Prima Miſta;</hi> of theſe they compound a Starry <hi>Regulus,</hi> and to this they add according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, either Gold, or Silver, which makes with it a new and further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. To this they add Sublimate, which is it ſelf a De-compound body, (conſiſting of common Quickſilver, and divers Salts United by Sublimation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cryſtalline Subſtance) and from this Sublimate, and the other Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Mixtures, they draw a Liquor, which may be allow'd to be of a yet more Compounded Nature. If it be true, as Chymiſts affirm it, that by this Art ſome of the Gold or Silver mingl'd with the <hi>Regulus</hi> may be carry'd over the Helme with it by the Sublimate; as indeed a Skilfull and Candid perſon complain'd to me a while ſince, That an experienc'd Friend of His and mine, having by ſuch a way brought over a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105458:119"/>great Deal of Gold, in hope to do ſomething further with it, which might be gainfull to him, has not only miſs'd of his Aim, but is unable to recover his Volatiliz'd Gold out of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial butter, wherewith it is ſtrictly united.</p>
                  <p>Now (Continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) if a Compound body conſiſt of Ingredients that are not meerly Elementary; it is not hard to conceive, that the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into which the Fire Diſſolves it, though ſeemingly Homogeneous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, may be of a Compounded Nature, thoſe parts of each body that are moſt of Kin aſſociating themſelves into a Compound of a new Kind. As when (for example ſake) I have caus'd Vitrioll and <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and Salt Petre to be mingl'd and Deſtill'd together, the Liquor that came over manifeſted it ſelf not to be either Spirit of Nitre, or of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> or of Vitrioll. For none of theſe would diſſolve crude gold, which yet my Liquor was able readily to do; and thereby manifeſted it ſelf to be a new Compound, conſiſting at leaſt of Spirit of Nitre, and <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> (for the latter diſſolv'd in the former,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105458:120"/>will Work on Gold) which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs are not by any known way ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, and conſequently would not paſs for a Mixt Body, if we our ſelves did not, to obtain it, put and Diſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether divers Concretes, whoſe Diſtinct Operations were known before hand. And, to add on this Occaſion the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment I lately promis'd You, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Applicable to our preſent purpoſe, I ſhall Acquaint You, that ſuſpecting the Common Oyle of Vitrioll not to be altogether ſuch a ſimple Liquor as Chymiſts preſume it, I mingl'd it with an equal or a Double Quantity (for I try'd the Experiment more then once) of common Oyle of Turpentine, ſuch as together with the other Liquor I bought at the Drugſters. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carefully (for the Experiment is Nice, and ſomewhat dangerous) Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd the Mixture in a ſmall Glaſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, I obtain'd according to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, (beſides the two Liquors I had put in) a pretty Quantity of a certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which ſticking all about the Neck of the Retort Diſcover'd it ſelf to be Sulphur, not only by a very ſtrong Sulphureous ſmell, and by the colour of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105458:120"/>Brimſtone; but alſo by this, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon a coal, it was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindl'd, and burn'd like common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. And of this Subſtance I have yet by me ſome little Parcells, which You may command and examine when you pleaſe. So that from this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I may deduce either one, or both of theſe Propoſitions, That a real Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur may be made by the Conjunction of two ſuch Subſtances as Chymiſts take for Elementary, And which did not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them apart appear to have any ſuch body in it; or that Oyle of Vitrioll though a Diſtill'd Liquor, and taken for part of the Saline Principle of the Concrete that yields it, may yet be ſo Compounded a body as to contain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its Saline part, a Sulphur like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brimſtone, which would hardly be it ſelf a ſimple or un-compounded body.</p>
                  <p>I might (purſues <hi>Carneades</hi>) remind You, that I formerly repreſented it, as poſſible, That as there may be more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements then five, or ſix; ſo the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one body may be Different from thoſe of another; whence it would follow, that from the Reſolution of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compound
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105458:121"/>compound body, there may reſult Mixts of an altogether new kind, by the Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Elements that never perhaps conven'd before. I might, I ſay, mind You of this, and add divers things to this ſecond Conſideration; but for fear of wanting time I willingly pretermit them, to paſs on to the third, which is this, That the Fire does not alwayes barely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve or take aſunder, but may alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new manner mingle and compound together the parts (whether Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or not) of the Body Diſſipated by it.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo evident, ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> in ſome obvious Examples, that I cannot but wonder at their Supineſs that have not taken notice of it. For when Wood being burnt in a Chimney is diſſipated by the Fire into Smoke and Aſhes, that ſmoke compoſes ſoot, which is ſo far from being any one of the principles of the Wood, that (as I noted above) you may by a further <hi>Anlyſis</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate five or ſix diſtinct ſubſtances from it. And as for the remaining Aſhes, the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts themſelves teach us, that by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of fire they may be indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly united into glaſs. 'Tis true, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:105458:121"/>which the Chymiſts principally build upon is made, not in the open air, but in cloſe Veſſels; but however, the Examples lately produc'd may invite you ſhrewdly to ſuſpect, That heat may as well compound as diſſipate the Parts of mixt Bodies: and not to tell you, that I have known a Vitrification made even in cloſe veſſels, I muſt remind you that the Flowers of Antimony, and thoſe of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, are very mix'd Bodies, though they aſcend in cloſe veſſells: And that 'twas in ſtopt glaſſes that I brought up the whole Body of Camphire. And whereas it may be objected, that all theſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are of Bodies forc'd up in a dry, not a Fluid forme, as are the Liquors wont to be obtain'd by diſtillation; I anſwer, That beſides that 'tis poſſible, that a Body may be chang'd from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent to Fluid, or from Fluid to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, without being otherwiſe much altered, as may appear by the Eaſineſs wherewith in Winter, without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Separation of Viſible Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the ſame ſubſtance may be quickly harden'd into brittle Ice, and thaw'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Fluid Water; Beſides this, I ſay it would be conſider'd, that common
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105458:122"/>Quick-ſilver it ſelf, which the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Chymiſts confeſs to be a mixt Body, may he Driven over the Helme in its Priſtine forme of Quickſilver, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, in that of a Liquor. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis poſſible that very compounded Bodies may concur to Conſtitute Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; Since, not to mention that I have found it poſſible, by the help of a certain <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> to diſtill Gold it ſelf through a Retort, even with a Moderate Fire: Let us but conſider what happens in Butter of Antimony. For if that be carefully rectify'd, it may be reduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very clear Liquor; and yet if You caſt a quantity of fair water upon it, there will quickly precipitate a Ponderous and Vomitive Calx, which made before a conſiderable part of the Liquor, and yet is indeed (though ſome eminent Chymiſts would have it Mercurial) an Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body carryed over and kept diſſolv'd by the Salts of the Sublimate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a compounded one; as You may find if You will have the Curioſity to Examine this White powder by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reduction. And that You may not think that Bodies as compounded as flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Brimſtone cannot be brought
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105458:122"/>to Concurr to Conſtitute Diſtill'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; And alſo That You may not imagine with Divers Learned Men that pretend no ſmall skill in Chymiſtry, that at leaſt no mixt Body can be brought over the Helme, but by corroſive Salts, I am ready to ſhew You, when You pleaſe, among other wayes of bringing over Flowers of Brimſtone (perhaps I might add even Mineral Sulphurs) ſome, wherein I employ none but Oleaginous bodies to make Volatile Liquors, in which not only the colour, but (which is a much ſurer mark) the ſmell and ſome Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions manifeſt that there is brought over a Sulphur that makes part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                  <p>One thing more there is, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> which is ſo pertinent to my preſent purpoſe, that though I have touch'd upon it before, I cannot but on this occaſion take notice of it. And it is this, That the Qualities or Accidents, upon whoſe account Chymiſts are wont to call a portion of Matter by the name of Mercury or ſome other of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are not ſuch but that 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as Great (and therefore why not the like?) may be produc'd by ſuch changes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105458:123"/>of Texture, and other Alterations, as the Fire may make in the ſmall Parts of a Body. I have already prov'd, when I diſcours'd of the ſecond General Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, by what happens to plants nouriſh'd only with fair water, and Eggs hatch'd into Chickens, that by changing the diſpoſition of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of a Body, Nature is able to effect as great Changes in a parcell of Matter reputed ſimilar, as thoſe requiſite to Denominate one of the <hi>Tria Prima.</hi> And though <hi>Helmont</hi> do ſomewhere wittily call the Fire the Deſtructor and the Artificial Death of Things; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though another Eminent Chymiſt and Phyſitian be pleas'd to build upon this, That Fire can never generate any thing but Fire; Yet You will, I doubt not, be of another mind, If You conſider how many new ſorts of mixt Bodies Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts themſelves have produc'd by means of the Fire: And particularly, if You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how that Noble and Permanent Body, Glaſs, is not only manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the violent action of the Fire, but has never, for ought we know, been produc'd any other way. And indeed it ſeems but an inconſiderate Aſſertion of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105458:123"/>ſome <hi>Helmontians,</hi> that every ſort of Body of a Peculiar Denomination muſt be produc'd by ſome Seminal power; as I think I could evince, if I thought it ſo neceſſary, as it is for me to haſten to what I have further to diſcourſe. Nor need it much move us, that there are ſome who look upon whatſoever the Fire is employ'd to produce, not as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Natural but Artificial Bodies. For there is not alwaies ſuch a difference as many imagine betwixt the one and the other: Nor is it ſo eaſy as they think, clearly to aſſigne that which Properly, Conſtantly, and Sufficiently, Diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates them. But not to engage my ſelf in ſo nice a Diſquiſition, it may now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to obſerve, that a thing is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed Artificial, when a parcel of matter is by the Artificers hand, or Tools, or both, brought to ſuch a ſhape or Form, as he Deſign'd before-hand in his Mind: Whereas in many of the Chymical Productions the effect would be produc'd whether the Artificer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it or no; and is oftentimes very much other then he Intended or Look't for; and the Inſtruments employ'd, are not Tools Artificially faſhion'd and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105458:124"/>ſhaped, like thoſe of Tradeſmen, for this or that particular Work; but, for the moſt part, Agents of Nature's own providing, and whoſe chief Powers of Operation they receive from their own Nature or Texture, not the Artificer. And indeed, the Fire is as well a Natural Agent as Seed: And the Chymiſt that imployes it, does but apply Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Patients, who being thus brought together, and acting according to their reſpective Natures, performe the worke themſelves; as Apples, Plums, or other fruit, are natural Productions, though the Gardiner bring and faſten together the Sciens of the Stock, and both Water, and do perhaps divers other wayes Contribute to its bearing fruit. But, to proceed to what I was going to ſay, You may obſerve with me, <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> that, as I told You once before, Qualities ſleight enough may ſerve to Denominate a Chymical Principle. For, when they anatomize a compound Body by the Fire, if they get a Subſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable, and that will not mingle with Water, that they preſently call Sulphur; what is ſapid and Diſſoluble in Water, that muſt paſſe for Salt; Whatſoever is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105458:124"/>fix'd and indiſſoluble in Water, that they name Earth. And I was going to add, that, whatſoever Volatile ſubſtance they know not what to make of, not to ſay, whatſoever they pleaſe, that they call Mercury. But that theſe Qualities may either be produc'd, otherwiſe then by ſuch as they call Seminal Agents, or may belong to bodies of a compounded Nature, may be ſhewn, among other Inſtances, in Glaſs made of aſhes, where the exceeding ſtrongly-taſted <hi>Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate</hi> Salt joyning with the Earth becomes inſipid, and with it conſtitutes a Body, which though alſo dry, fixt, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble in Water, is yet manifeſtly a mixt Body; and made ſo by the Fire it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And I remmember to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that <hi>Helmont,</hi> amongſt other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that he commends, has a ſhort proceſſe, wherein, though the Directions for Practice are but obſcurely intimated; yet I have ſome reaſon not to Diſ-believe the Proceſs, without affirming or denying any thing about the vertues of the remedy to be made by it.

And the like conjecture I have alſo made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirit of Vinager, which, though the Chymiſts think one of the Principles
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105458:125"/>of that Body, and though being an Acid Spirit it ſeems to be much leſs of kin then Volatile Salts to ſulphurs; yet, not to mention its piercing ſmell; which I know not with what congruity the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt will deduce from Salt, I wonder they have not taken notice of what their own <hi>Tyrocinium Chymicum</hi> teach us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Deſtillation of <hi>Saccharum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turni;</hi> out of which <hi>Beguinus</hi> aſſures Us,
<note place="margin">Tyroc. Chym. L. 1. C. 4.</note> that he diſtill'd, beſides a very fine ſpirit, no leſſe then two Oyles, the one blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ponderous, but the other ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon the top of the Spirit, and of a yellow colour; of which he ſayes that he kept then ſome by him, to verify what he delivers. And though I remember not that I have had two diſtinct Oyles from Sugar of Lead, yet that it will though diſtill'd without addition yield ſome Oyle, diſagrees not with my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. I know the Chymiſts will be apt to pretend, that theſe Oyls are but the volatiliz'd ſulphur of the lead; and will perhaps argue it from what <hi>Beguinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that when the Diſtillation is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you'l find a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly black, and (as he ſpeaks) <hi>nullius momenti,</hi> as if the Body, or at leaſt the chief part of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105458:126"/>the Metal it ſelf were by the diſtillation carried over the Helme. But ſince you know as well as I that <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> is a kind of Magiſtery, made only by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining of Lead <hi>per ſe,</hi> diſſolving it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Vinager, and cryſtalizing the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; if I had leaſure to tell You how Differing a thing I did upon examination find the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> ſo ſleighted by <hi>Beguinus,</hi> to be from what he repreſents it, I believe you would think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture propos'd leſs probable then one or other of theſe three; either that this Oyle did formerly concur to conſtitute the Spirit of Vinager, and ſo that what paſſes for a Chymical Principle may yet be further reſoluble into diſtinct ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or that ſome parts of the Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome parts of the Lead may conſtitute a Chymical Oyle, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it paſs for Homogeneous, may be a very compounded Body: or at leaſt that by the action of the Diſtill'd Vinager and the Saturnine Calx one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, part of the Liquor may be ſo alter'd as to be tranſmuted from an Acid Spirit into an Oyle. And though the truth of either of the two former conjectures would make the example I
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105458:126"/>have reflected on more pertinent to my preſent argument; yet you'l eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the Third and laſt Conjecture cannot be unſerviceable to confirm ſome other paſſages of my diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>To return then to what I was ſaying juſt before I mention'd <hi>Helmont's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, I ſhall ſubjoyne, That Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts muſt confeſs alſo that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Dephlegm'd ſpirit of Wine, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fermented Liquors, that which they call the Sulphur of the Concrete loſes, by the Fermentation, the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Oyle, (which the Chymiſts likewiſe take to be the true Sulphur of the Mixt) of being unminglable with the Water.

Helmont. in Aura vitali.</note> And if You will credit <hi>Helmont,</hi> all of the pureſt Spirit of Wine may barely by the help of pure Salt of Tartar (which is but the fixed Salt of Wine) be reſolv'd or Tranſmuted into ſcarce half an ounce of Salt, and as much Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Water as amounts to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the mention'd weight. And it may (as I think I formerly alſo noted) be doubted, whether that Fixt and Alcalizate Salt, which is ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed on to be the Saline Principle of incinerated Bodies, be not,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105458:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>as 'tis Alcalizate, a Production of the Fire? For though the taſt of Tartar, for Example, ſeem to argue that it contains a Salt before it be burn'd, yet that Salt being very Acid is of a quite Differing Taſt from the Lixiviate Salt of Calcin'd Tartar. And though it be not truly Objected againſt the Chymiſts, that they obtain all Salts they make, by reducing the Body they work on into Aſhes with Violent Fires, (ſince Hartshorn, Amber, Blood, and divers other Mixts yield a copious Salt before they be burn'd to Aſhes) yet this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt Differs much, as we ſhall ſee anon, from the Fixt Alcalizate Salt I ſpeak of; which for ought I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not producible by any known Way, without Incineration. 'Tis not unknown to Chymiſts, that Quickſilver may be Precipitated, without Addition, into a dry Powder, that remains ſo in Water. And ſome eminent <hi>Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,</hi> and even <hi>Raimund Lully</hi> himſelf, teach, that meerly by the Fire Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver may in convenient Veſſels be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd (at leaſt in great part) into a thin Liquor like Water, and mingla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with it. So that by the bare Action
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105458:127"/>of the Fire, 'tis poſſible, that the parts of a mixt Body ſhould be ſo diſpos'd after new and differing manners, that it may be ſometimes of one conſiſtence, ſometimes of another; And may in one State be diſpos'd to be mingl'd with Water, and in another not. I could alſo ſhew you, that Bodies from which apart Chymiſts cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing that is Combuſtible, may by being aſſociated together, and by the help of the Fire, afford an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable Subſtance. And that on the other ſide, 'tis poſſible for a Body to be inflamable, from which it would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much puzzle any ordinary Chymiſt, and perhaps any other, to ſeparate an inflamable Principle or Ingredient. Wherefore, ſince the Principles of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts may receive their Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Qualities, which it often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not the power of Art, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that of the Fire to produce; And ſince ſuch Qualities may be found in Bodies that differ ſo much in other Qualities from one another, that they need not be allow'd to agree in that pure and ſimple Nature, which Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to be ſo indeed, muſt have; it may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105458:128"/>juſtly be ſuſpected, that many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Fire that are ſhew'd us by Chymiſts, as the Principles of the Concrete that afforded them, may be but a new kind of Mixts. And to annex, on this Occaſion, to theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from the Nature of the thing, one of thoſe which <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> I ſhall deſire You to take Notice, that though <hi>Paracelſus</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſome that are ſo miſtaken as to think he could not be ſo, have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to teach, that not only the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here below, but the Elements themſelves, and all the other Parts of the Univerſe, are compos'd of Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; yet the learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and all the more wary Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, have rejected that conceit, and do many of them confeſs, that the <hi>Tria Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> are each of them made up of the four Elements; and others of them make Earth and Water concur with Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Mixt bodies. So that one ſort of theſe <hi>Spagyriſts,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſpecious Titles they give to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Fire, do in effect grant what I contend for. And, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105458:128"/>ſort I may well demand, to what Kind of Bodies the Phlegme and dead Earth, to be met with in Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, are to be referr'd? For either they muſt ſay, with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Conceſſions as well as againſt Experience, that theſe are alſo compos'd of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> whereof they cannot ſeparate any one from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; or elſe they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that two of the vaſteſt Bodies here below, Earth, and Water, are neither of them compos'd of the <hi>Tria Prima;</hi> and that conſequently thoſe three are not the Univerſal, and Adequate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, neither of all Sublunary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor even of all mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>I know that the chief of theſe Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts repreſent, that though the Diſtinct Subſtances into which they divide mixt bodies by the Fire, are not pure and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous; yet ſince the four Elements into which the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> pretend to reſolve the like bodies by the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, are not ſimple neither, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge, 'tis as allowable for the Chymiſts to call the one Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as for the Peripateticks to call the other Elements; ſince in both caſes the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105458:129"/>Impoſition of the name is grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Predominancy of that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whoſe name is aſcrib'd to it. Nor ſhall I deny, that this Argument of the Chymiſts is no ill one againſt the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians.</hi> But what Anſwer can it prove to me, who you know am diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Elements, as the Chymicall Principles, and muſt not look upon any body as a true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Element, but as yet compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which is not perfectly Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but is further Reſoluble into any number of Diſtinct Subſtances how ſmall ſoever. And as for the Chymiſts calling a body Salt, or Sulphur, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, upon pretence that the Principle of the ſame name is predominant in it, That it ſelf is an Acknowledgment of what I contend for; namely that theſe productions of the Fire, are yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodies. And yet whilſt this is granted, it is affirm'd, but not prov'd, that the reputed Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, conſiſts mainly of one body that deſerves the name of a principle of the ſame Denomination. For how do Chymiſts make it appear that there are any ſuch primitive and ſimple bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105458:129"/>in thoſe we are ſpeaking of; ſince 'tis upon the matter confeſs'd by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer lately made, that theſe are not ſuch? And if they pretend by Reaſon to evince what they affirm, what becomes of their confident boaſts, that the Chymiſts (whom they therefore, after <hi>Beguinus,</hi> call a <hi>Philoſophus</hi> or <hi>Opifex Senſatus</hi>) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our Eyes, by manifeſtly ſhewing in any mixt body thoſe ſimple ſubſtances he teaches them to be compos'd of? And indeed, for the Chymiſts to have recourſe in this caſe to other proofs then Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it is to wave the grand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that has all this while been given out for a Demonſtrative One; ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes me from the obligation to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Diſpute wherein I am not engag'd to Examine any but Experimentall proofs. I know it may plauſibly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be Repreſented, in favour of the Chymiſts, that it being evident that much the greater part of any thing they call Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, is really ſuch; it would be very rigid to deny thoſe Subſtances the names aſcribed them, only becauſe of ſome ſleight mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of another Body; ſince not only the Peripateticks call particular parcels of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105458:130"/>matter Elementary, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Elements are not to be anywhere found pure, at leaſt here below; And ſince eſpecially there is a manifeſt Analogie and Reſemblance betwixt the bodies obtainable by Chymical Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and the principles whoſe names are given them; I have, I ſay, conſider'd that theſe things may be repreſented: But as for what is drawn from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Peripateticks, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told You, that though it may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd againſt Them, Yet it is not availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt me who allow nothing to be an Element that is not perfectly Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous. And whereas it is alledg'd, that the Predominant Principle ought to give a name to the ſubſtance wherein it abounds; I anſwer, that that might much more reaſonably be ſaid, if either we or the Chymiſts had ſeen Nature take pure Salt, pure Sulphur, and pure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and compound of them every ſort of Mixt Bodies. But, ſince 'tis to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that they appeal, we muſt not take it for granted, that the Diſtill'd Oyle (for inſtance) of a plant is mainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of the pure principle call'd Sulphur, till they have given us an ocular proof,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105458:130"/>that there is in that ſort of Plants ſuch an Homogeneous Sulphur. For as for the ſpecious argument, which is drawn from the Reſemblance betwixt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Fire, and the Reſpective, either <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Elements, or <hi>Chymical</hi> Principles, by whoſe names they are call'd; it will appear more plauſible then cogent, if You will but recall to mind the ſtate of the controverſie; which is not, whether or no there be obtain'd from mixt Bodies certain ſubſtances that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in outward appearance, or in ſome Qualities with Quickſilver or Brimſtone, or ſome ſuch obvious or copious Body; But whether or no all Bodies confeſs'd to be perfectly mixt were compos'd of, and are reſoluble into a determinate number of primary unmixt Bodies. For, if you keep the ſtate of the queſtion in your Eye, you'l eaſily diſcerne that there is much of what ſhould be Demonſtrated, left unprov'd by thoſe Chymical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are Examining. But (not to repeat what I have already diſcover'd more at large) I ſhall now take notice, that it will not preſently follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Production of the Fire has ſome affinity with ſome of the greater Maſſes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:105458:131"/>of matter here below, that therefore they are both of the ſame Nature, and deſerve the ſame Name; for the Chymiſts are not content, that flame ſhould be look't upon as a parcel of the Element of Fire, though it be hot, dry, and active, becauſe it wants ſome other Qualities belonging to the nature of Elementary fire. Nor will they let the Peripateticks call Aſhes, or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, Earth, notwithſtanding the many likeneſſes between them; becauſe they are not taſtleſſe, as Elementary Earth ought to be: But if you ſhould ask me, what then it is, that all the Chymical Anatomies of Bodies do prove, if they prove not that they conſiſt of the three Principles into which the fire reſolves them? I anſwer, that their Diſſections may be granted to prove, that ſome mixt bodies (for in many it will not hold) are by the fire, when they are included in cloſe Veſſels, (for that Condition alſo is often requiſite) diſſolube into ſeveral Subſtances differing in ſome Qualities, but principally in Conſiſtence. So that out of moſt of them may be obtain'd a fixt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance partly ſaline, and partly inſipid, an unctuous Liquor, and another Liquor or
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105458:131"/>more that without being unctuous have a manifeſt taſte. Now if Chymiſts will agree to call the dry and ſapid ſubſtance ſalt, the Unctuous liquor Sulphur, and the other Mercury, I ſhall not much quarrel with them for ſo doing: But if they will tell me that Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, are ſimple and primary bodies whereof each mixt body was actually compounded, and which was really in it antecedently to the operation of the fire, they muſt give me leave to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whatever their other arguments may do) their Experiments prove all this. And if they will alſo tell me that the Subſtances their Anatomies are wont to afford them, are pure and ſimilar, as Principles ought to be, they muſt give me leave to believe my own ſenſes; and their own confeſſions, before their bare Aſſertions. And that you may not <hi>(Eleutherius)</hi> think I deal ſo rigidly with them, becauſe I ſcruple to Take theſe Productions of the Fire for ſuch as the Chymiſts would have them paſs for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their having ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with them; conſider a little with me, that in regard an Element or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to be perfectly Similar and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105458:132"/>Homogeneous, there is no juſt cauſe why I ſhould rather give the body propos'd the Name of this or that Element or Principle, becauſe it has a reſemblance to it in ſome obvious Quality, rather then deny it that name upon the account of divers other Qualities, wherein the propos'd Bodies are unlike; and if you do but conſider what ſleight and eaſily producible qualities they are that ſuffice, as I have already more then once obſerv'd, to Denominate a Chymical Principle or an Element, you'l not, I hope, think my warineſs to be deſtitute either of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or elſe of Reaſon. For we ſee that the Chymiſts will not allow the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians</hi> that the Salt in Aſhes ought to be called Earth, though the Saline and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial part ſymbolize in weight, in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in fixneſs and fuſibility, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one is ſapid and diſſoluble in Water, and the other not: Beſides, we ſee that ſapidneſs and volatility are wont to denominate the Chymiſts Mercury or Spirit; and yet how many Bodies, think you, may agree in thoſe Qualities which may yet be of very differing natures, and diſagree in qualities either more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or more conſiderable, or both. For
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:105458:132"/>not only Spirit of Nitre, Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Oyle of Vitriol, Spirit of Allome, Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager, and all Saline Liquors Diſtill'd from Animal Bodies, but all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetous Spirits of Woods freed from their Vinager; All theſe, I ſay, and many others muſt belong to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Mercury, though it appear not why ſome of them ſhould more be comprehended under one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the Chymiſts Sulphur, or Oyle ſhould likewiſe be; for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Oyles are alſo Fluid, Volatile, and Taſtable, as well as their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; Nor is it Neceſſary, that their Sulphur ſhould be Unctuous or Diſſoluble in Water, ſince they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally referr Spirit of Wine to Sulphurs, although that Spirit be not Unctuous, and will freely mingle with Water. So that bare Inflamability muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Eſſence of the Chymiſts Sulphur; as uninflamableneſſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any taſte is enough to intitle a Diſtill'd Liquor to be their Mercury. Now ſince I can further obſerve to You, that Spirit of Nitre and Spirit of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne being pour'd together will boile
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:105458:133"/>and hiſſe and toſſe up one another into the air, which the Chymiſts make ſignes of great Antipathy in the Natures of Bodies (as indeed theſe Spirits differ much both in Taſte, Smell, and Operations;) Since I elſewhere tell you of my having made two ſorts of Oyle out of the ſame mans blood, that would not mingle with one another; And ſince I might tell You Divers Examples I have met with, of the Contrariety of Bodies which according to the Chymiſts muſt be huddl'd up together under one Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; I leave you to Judge whether ſuch a multitude of Subſtances as may agree in theſe ſleight Qualities, and yet Diſagree in Others more Conſiderable, are more worthy to be call'd by the Name of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which ought to be pure and homogeneous,) than to have appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given them that may make them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, in name too, from the bodies from which they ſo wildly differ in Nature. And hence alſo, by the bye, you may perceive that 'tis not unreaſonable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the Chymiſts way of Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when being unable to ſhew us that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:105458:133"/>ſuch a Liquor is (for Example) purely ſaline, they prove, that at leaſt ſalt is much the predominant principle, becauſe that the propos'd ſubſtance is ſtrongly taſted, and all Taſt proceeds from ſalt; whereas thoſe Spirits, ſuch as ſpirit of Tartar, ſpirit of Harts-horn, and the like, which are reckoned to be the Mercuries of the Bodies that afford them, have manifeſtly a ſtrong and piercing taſt, and ſo has (according to what I formerly noted) the ſpirit of Box &amp;c. even after the acid Liquor that concurr'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it has been ſeparated from it. And indeed, if ſapidneſs belong not to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Mercurial Principle of Vegitables and Animals: I ſcarce know how it will be diſcriminated from their phlegm, ſince by the abſence of Inflamability it muſt be diſtinguiſh'd from their ſulphur, which affords me another Example, to prove how unacurate the Chymical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is in our preſent Caſe; ſince not only the ſpirits of Vegitables and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, but their Oyles are very ſtrongly taſted, as he that ſhall but wet his tongue with Chymical Oyle of Cinnamon, or of Cloves, or even of Turpentine, may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find, to his ſmart. And not only I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105458:134"/>never try'd any Chymical Oyles whoſe taſt was not very manifeſt and ſtrong; but a skilful and inquiſitive perſon who made it his buſineſs by elaborate operations to depurate Chymical Oyles, and reduce them to an Elementary ſimplicity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, that he never was able to make them at all Taſtleſs; whence I might inferr, that the proof Chymiſts confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently give us of a bodies being ſaline, is ſo far from demonſtrating the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, that it does not clearly Evince ſo much as the preſence of the ſaline Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in it. But I will not (purſues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>) remind you, that the Volatile ſalt of Harts-horn, Amber, Blood, &amp;c. are exceeding ſtrongly ſcented, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that moſt Chymiſts deduce O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from Sulphur, and from them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the Predominancy of that Principle in the Odorous body, becauſe I muſt not ſo much as add any new Examples of the incompetency of this ſort of Chymical arguments; ſince having already detain'd You but too long in thoſe generals that appertain to my fourth conſideration, 'tis time that I proceed to the particulars themſelves, to which I thought fit they ſhould be previous:</p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:105458:134"/>
                  <p>Theſe Generals (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) being thus premis'd, we might the better ſurvey the Unlikeneſs that an attentive and unprepoſſeſs'd obſerver may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in each ſort of Bodies which the Chymiſts are wont to call the ſalts or ſulphurs or Mercuries of the Concretes that yield Them, as if they had all a ſimplicity, and Identity of Nature: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſalts if they were all Elementary would as little differ as do the Drops of pure and ſimple Water. 'Tis known that both Chymiſts and Phyſitians aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the fixt ſalts of calcin'd Bodies the vertues of their concretes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently very differing Operations. So we find the <hi>Alkali</hi> of Wormwood much commended in diſtempers of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; that of Eyebright for thoſe that have a weak ſight; and that of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> (of which a great Quantity yields but a very little ſalt) is not only much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Venereal Diſeaſes, but is believed to have a peculiar purgative vertue, which yet I have not had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to try. And though, I confeſs, I have long thought, that theſe <hi>Alkalizate</hi> ſalts are, for the moſt part, very neer of kin, and retain very little of the properties of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105458:135"/>the Concretes whence they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; Yet being minded to Obſerve watchfully whether I could meet with any Exceptions to this General Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I obſerv'd at the Glaſſe-houſe, that ſometimes the Metal (as the Workmen call it) or Maſſe of colliquated Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which by Blowing they faſhion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Veſſels of divers ſhapes, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove of a very differing colour, and a ſomewhat differing Texture, from what was uſuall. And having enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe of ſuch Accidents might not be derived from the peculiar Nature of the fixt ſalt employ'd to bring the ſand to fuſion, I found that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſt Workmen imputed theſe Miſ-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures to the Aſhes, of ſome certain kind of Wood, as having obſerv'd the ignobler kind of Glaſs I lately mention'd to be frequently produc'd when they had employ'd ſuch ſorts of Aſhes which therefore they ſcruple to make uſe of, if they took notice of them beforehand. I remember alſo, that an Induſtrious Man of my acquaintance having bought a vaſt quantity of Tobacco ſtalks to make a fixt Salt with, I had the Curioſity to go ſee whether that Exotick Plant, which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105458:135"/>ſo much abounds in volatile ſalt, would afford a peculiar kind of <hi>Alcali;</hi> and I was pleas'd to find that in the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of it, it was not neceſſary, as is uſual, to evaporate all the Liquor, that there might be obtain'd a Saline Calx, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting like lime quench'd in the Air of a heap of little Corpuſcles of unregarded ſhapes: but the fixt ſalt ſhot into figur'd Cryſtal, almoſt as Nitre or <hi>Sal-armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> and other uncalcin'd ſalts are wont to do; And I further remember that I have obſerv'd in the fixt Salt of Urine, brought by depuration to be very white, a taſt not ſo unlike to that of common ſalt, and very differing from the wonted cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Lixiviate taſt of other ſalts made by Incineration. But becauſe the Inſtances I have alledg'd of the Difference of <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate</hi> ſalt are but few, and therefore I am ſtill inclin'd to think, that moſt Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and many Phyſitians do, inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly enough and without Warrant from Experience, aſcribe the Vertues of the Concretes expos'd to Calcination, to the ſalts obtain'd by it; I ſhall rather, to ſhew the Diſparity of ſalts, mention in the firſt Place the apparent Difference betwixt the Vegetable fixt ſalts and the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105458:136"/>Animal Volatile ones: As (for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) betwixt ſalt of Tartar, and ſalt of Harts-horn; whereof the former is ſo fixt that 'twill indure the brunt of a violent Fire, and ſtand in fuſion like a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; whereas the other (beſides that it has a differing taſt and a very differing ſmell) is ſo far from being fixt, that it will fly away in a gentle heat as eaſily as ſpirit of Wine it ſelf. And to this I ſhall add, in the next place, That even among the Volatile ſalts themſelves, there is a conſiderable Difference, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the diſtinct Properties of (for Inſtance) ſalt of Amber, ſalt of Urine, ſalt of Mans Skull, (ſo much extoll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the falling Sickneſſe) and divers others which cannot eſcape an ordinary Obſerver. And this Diverſity of Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalts I have obſerv'd to be ſomtimes Diſcernable even to the Eye, in their Figures. For the ſalt of Harts-horn I have obſerv'd to adhere to the Receiver in the forme almoſt of a <hi>Parallelipipedon;</hi> and of the Volatile ſalt of humane blood (long digeſted before diſtillation, with ſpirit of Wine) I can ſhew you ſtore of graines of that Figure which <hi>Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> call a <hi>Rhombus;</hi> though I dare not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105458:136"/>undertake that the Figures of theſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saline Cryſtals (if I may ſo call Them) will be alwaies the ſame, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever degree of Fire have been employ'd to force them up, or how haſtily ſoever they have been made to convene in the ſpirits or liquors, in the lower part of which I have uſually obſerv'd them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while to ſhoot. And although, as I lately told You, I ſeldom found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difference, as to Medical Vertues, in the fixt Salts of Divers Vegetables; and accordingly I have ſuſpected that moſt of theſe volatile Salts, having ſo great a Reſemblance in ſmell, in taſt, and fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, differ but little, if at all, in their Medicinal properties: As indeed I have found them generally to agree in divers of them (as in their being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Diaphoretick and very Deopila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105458:137"/>but the Latter will. Of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy alſo of the Salt of Common Amber againſt the ſame Diſeaſe in Children, (for in Grown Perſons it is not a ſpecifick) I may elſewhere have an Occaſion to Entertain You. And when I conſider that to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe Volatile Salts (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of Urine) there is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſuch a Deſtructive Violence of the Fire, as there is to get thoſe Salts that muſt be made by Incineration, I am the more invited to conclude, that they may differ from one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently recede from an Elementary Simplicity. And, if I could here ſhew You what Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has Obſerv'd, touching the Various Chymicall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Salts; You would quickly diſcern, not only that Chymiſts do give themſelves a ſtrange Liberty to call Concretes Salts, that are according to their own Rules to be look'd upon as very Compounded Bodies; but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe very Salts that ſeem Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, becauſe produc'd upon the Anatomy of the Bodies that yield them, there is not only a viſible Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but, to ſpeak in the common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105458:137"/>a manifeſt Antipathy or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety: As is evident in the Ebullition and hiſſing that is wont to enſue, when the Acid Spirit of Vitrioll, for Inſtance, is pour'd upon pot aſhes, or Salt of Tartar. And I ſhall beg leave of this Gentleman, ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes on me, to let me obſerve to You out of ſome of his papers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe wherein he treats of ſome Preparations of Urine, that not only one and the ſame body may have two Salts of a contrary Nature, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifies in the Spirit and <hi>Alkali</hi> of Nitre; but that from the ſame body there may without addition be obtain'd three differing and Viſible Salts. For He Relates, that he obſerv'd in Urine, not only a Volatile and Cryſtalline Salt, and a fixt Salt, but likewiſe a kind of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> or ſuch a Salt as would ſublime in the form of a ſalt, and therefore was not fixt, and yet was far from being ſo fugitive as the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſalt; from which it ſeem'd alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to differ. I have indeed ſuſpected that this may be a <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſo call'd, as Compounded of the Volatile ſalt of Urine, and the fixt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:105458:138"/>of the ſame Liquor, which, as I noted, is not unlike ſea-ſalt; but that it ſelf argues a manifeſt Difference betwixt the ſalts, ſince ſuch a Volatile ſalt is not wont to Unite thus with an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Alcali,</hi> but to fly away from it in the Heat. And on this occaſion I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, to give ſome of my Friends an Ocular proof of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the fixt and Volatile ſalt (of the ſame Concrete) Wood, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd the following Experiment. I took common Venetian ſublimate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd as much of it as I well could in fair Water: then I took Wood Aſhes, and pouring on them Warme Water, Diſſolv'd their ſalt; and filtrating the Water, as ſoon as I found the <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> ſufficiently ſharp upon the tongue, I reſerv'd it for uſe: Then on part of the former ſolution of ſublimate drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little of this Diſſolv'd Fixt ſalt of Wood, the Liquors preſently turn'd of an Orange Colour; but upon the other part of the clear ſolution of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate putting ſome of the Volatile ſalt of Wood (which abounds in the ſpirit of ſoot) the Liquor immediately turn'd white, almoſt like Milke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:105458:138"/>a while let fall a white ſediment, as the other Liquor did a Yellow one. To all this that I have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difference of ſalts,

And I might alſo annex, what I noted to you out of <hi>Helmont</hi> concerning Bodies, which, though they conſiſt in great part of Chymical Oyles, do yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear but Volatile ſalts; But to inſiſt on theſe things, were to repeat; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall proceed.</p>
                  <p>This Diſparity is alſo highly eminent in the ſeparated ſulphurs or Chymical Oyles of things. For they contain ſo much of the ſcent, and taſt, and vertues, of the Bodies whence they were drawn, that they ſeem to be but the Material <hi>Craſis</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) of their Concretes. Thus the Oyles of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:105458:139"/>Cloves, Nutmegs and other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeem to be but the United Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick parts that did ennoble thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And 'tis a known thing, that Oyl of Cinnamon, and oyle of Cloves, (which I have likewiſe obſerv'd in the Oyles of ſeveral Woods) will ſink to the Bottom of Water: whereas thoſe of Nutmegs and divers other Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables will ſwim upon it. The Oyle (abuſively call'd ſpirit) of Roſes ſwims at the Top of the Water in the forme of a white butter, which I remember not to have obſerv'd in any other Oyle drawn in any Limbeck; yet there is a way (not here to be declar'd) by which I have ſeen it come over in the forme of other Aromatick Oyles, to the Delight and Wonder of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it. In Oyle of Anniſeeds, which I drew both with, and without Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, I obſerv'd the whole Body of the Oyle in a coole place to thicken into the Conſiſtence and Appearance of white Butter, which with the leaſt heat reſum'd its Former Liquidneſs. In the Oyl of Olive drawn over in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, I have likewiſe more then once ſeen a ſpontaneous Coagulation in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105458:139"/>Receiver: And I have of it by me thus Congeal'd; which is of ſuch a ſtrangely Penetrating ſcent, as if 'twould Perforate the Noſes that approach it. The like pungent Odour I alſo obſerv'd in the Diſtill'd Liquor of common ſope, which forc'd over from <hi>Minium,</hi> lately afforded an oyle of a moſt admirable Penetrancy; And he muſt be a great ſtranger, both to the Writings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Chymiſts, that ſees not in the Oyles they diſtill from Vegetables and Animals, a conſiderable and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Difference. Nay I ſhall venture to add, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (what perhaps you will think of kin to a Paradox) that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times out of the ſame Animal or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, there may be extracted Oyles of Natures obviouſly differing. To which purpoſe I ſhall not inſiſt on the ſwimming and ſinking Oyles, which I have ſometimes obſerv'd to float on, and ſubſide under the ſpirit of <hi>Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and that of divers other Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Diſtill'd with a ſtrong and laſting Fire; Nor ſhall I inſiſt on the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation elſewhere mention'd, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and unminglable oyles afforded us by Humane Blood long fermented and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:105458:140"/>Digeſted with ſpirit of Wine, becauſe theſe kind of oyles may ſeem chiefly to differ in Conſiſtence and Weight, being all of them high colour'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt. But the Experiment which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to make out this Difference of the oyles of the ſame Vegetable, <hi>ad Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> (as they ſpeak) was this that followes. I took a pound of Anniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, and having groſly beaten them, cauſed them to be put into a very large glaſs Retort almoſt filled with fair Water; and placing this Retort in a ſand Furnace, I caus'd a very Gentle heat to be adminiſter'd during the firſt day, and a great part of the ſecond, till the VVater was for the moſt part drawn off, and had brought over with it at leaſt moſt of the Volatile and Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Oyle of the ſeeds. And then encreaſing the Fire, and changing the Receiver, I obtain'd beſides an Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reumatical Spirit, a quantity of aduſt oyle; whereof a little floated upon the Spirit, and the reſt was more heavy, and not eaſily ſeparable from it. And whereas theſe oyles were very dark, and ſmell'd (as Chymiſts ſpeak) ſo ſtrongly of the Fire, that their Odour
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:105458:140"/>did not betray from what Vegetables they had been forc'd; the other <hi>Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Oyle was enrich'd with the genuine ſmell and taſt of the Concrete; and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly coagulating it ſelf into white butter did manifeſt ſelf to be the true Oyle of Anniſſeeds; which Concrete I therefore choſe to employ about this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that the Difference of theſe Oyles might be more conſpicuous then it would have been, had I inſtead of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd another Vegetable.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot to take notice, that there is another ſort of Bodies, which though not obtain'd from Concretes by Diſtillation, many Chymiſts are wont to call their Sulphur; not only becauſe ſuch ſubſtances are, for the moſt part, high colour'd (whence they are alſo, and that more properly, called Tinctures) as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd Sulphurs are wont to be; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe they are, for the moſt part, abſtracted and ſeparated from the reſt of the Maſſe by Spirit of Wine: which Liquor thoſe men ſuppoſing to be Sulphureous, they conclude, that what it works upon, and abſtracts, muſt be a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur alſo. And upon this account they preſume, that they can ſequeſter the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:105458:141"/>even of Minerals and Metalls; from which 'tis known that they cannot by Fire alone ſeparate it. To all This I ſhall anſwer; That if theſe ſequeſtred ſubſtances where indeed the ſulphurs of the Bodies whence they are drawn, there would as well be a great Diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chymical Sulphurs obtain'd by Spirit of Wine, as I have already ſhewn there is betwixt thoſe obtain'd by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the forme of Oyles: which will be evident from hence, that not to urge that themſelves aſcribe diſtinct vertues to Mineral Tinctures, extolling the Tincture of Gold againſt ſuch and ſuch Diſeaſes; the Tincture of Antimony, or of its Glaſs, againſt others; and the Tincture of Emerauld againſt others; 'tis plain, that in Tinctures drawn from Vegetables, if the ſuperfluous ſpirit of Wine be diſtill'd off, it leaves at the bottom that thicker ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which Chymiſts uſe to call the Extract of the Vegetable. And that theſe Extracts are endow'd with very differing Qualities according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Particular Bodies that affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them (though I fear ſeldom with ſo much of the ſpecifick vertues as is wont to be imagin'd) is freely confeſs'd
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105458:141"/>both by Phyſitians and Chymiſts. But, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) we may here take Notice that the Chymiſts do as well in this caſe, as in many others, allow themſelves a Licenſe to abuſe Words: For not again to argue from the differing properties of Tinctures, that they are not exactly pure and Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sulphurs; they would eaſily appear not to be ſo much as Sulphur's, although we ſhould allow Chymical Oyles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Name. For however in ſome Mineral Tinctures the Natural fixtneſs of the extracted Body does not alwayes ſuffer it to be eaſily further reſoluble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to differing ſubſtances; Yet in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extracts drawn from Vegetables, it may very eaſily be manifeſted that the ſpirit of Wine has not ſequeſtred the ſulphureous Ingredient from the ſaline and Mercurial ones; but has diſſolv'd (for I take it to be a Solution) the finer Parts of the Concrete (without making any nice diſtinction of their being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sulphureous or not) and united it ſelf with them into a kind of Magiſtery; which conſequently muſt contain Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients or Parts of ſeveral ſorts. For we ſee that the ſtones that are rich in vitriol,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:105458:142"/>being often drench'd with rain-Water, the Liquor will then extract a ſine and tranſparent ſubſtance coagulable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vitriol; and yet though this Vitriol be readily diſſoluble in Water, it is not a true Elementary Salt, but, as You know, a body reſoluble into very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts, whereof one (as I ſhall have occaſion to tell You anon) is yet of a Metalline, and conſequently not of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Nature. You may conſider alſo, that common Sulphur is readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble in Oyle of Turpentine, though notwithſtanding its Name it abounds as well, if not as much, in Salt as in true Sulphur; witneſs the great quantity of ſaline Liquor it affords being ſet to flame away under a glaſſe Bell. Nay I have, which perhaps You will think ſtrange, with the ſame Oyle of Turpentine alone eaſily enough diſſolv'd crude Antimony finely powder'd into a Blood-red Balſam, wherewith perhaps conſiderable things may be perform'd in Surgery. And if it were now Requiſite, I could tell You of ſome other Bodies (ſuch as Perhaps You would not ſuſpect) that I have been able to work upon with certain Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oyles. But inſtead of digreſſing further
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:105458:142"/>I ſhall make this uſe of the Example I have nam'd. That 'tis not unlikely, but that Spirit of Wine which by its pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent taſt, and by ſome other Qualities that argue it better (eſpecially its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibleneſſe, according to <hi>Helmont,</hi> into <hi>Alcali,</hi> and Water,) ſeems to be as well of a Saline as of a Sulphureous Nature, may well be ſuppos'd Capable of Diſſolving Subſtances That are not meerly Elementary ſulphurs, though perhaps they may abound with Parts that are of kin thereunto. For I find that Spirit of Wine will diſſolve <hi>Gumm Lacca, Benzoine,</hi> and the <hi>Reſinous</hi> Parts of <hi>Jallap,</hi> and even of <hi>Guaiacum;</hi> whence we may well ſuſpect that it may from Spices, Herbs, and other leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Vegetables, extract ſubſtances that are not perfect Sulphurs but mixt Bodies. And to put it paſt Diſpute, there is many a Vulgar Extract drawn with Spirit of Wine, which committed to Diſtillation will afford ſuch differing ſubſtances as will Loudly proclaim it to have been a very compounded Body. So that we may juſtly ſuſpect, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Mineral Tinctures it will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follow, that becauſe a red ſubſtance
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:105458:143"/>is drawn from the Concrete by ſpirit of Wine, that Subſtance is its true and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Sulphur. And though ſome of theſe Extracts may perhaps be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable; Yet beſides that others are not, and beſides that their being reduc'd to ſuch Minuteneſs of Parts may much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate their taking Fire; beſides this, I ſay, We ſee that common Sulphur, common Oyle, Gumm Lac, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Unctuous and Reſinous Bodies, will flame well enough, though they be of very compounded natures: Nay Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers of Unſuſpected Credit aſſure Us, as a known thing, that in ſome Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries where Firr trees and Pines abound, the poorer ſort of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants uſe Long ſplinters of thoſe Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Woods to burne inſtead of Candles. And as for the redneſſe wont to be met with in ſuch ſolutions, I could eaſily ſhew, that 'tis not neceſſary it ſhould proceed from the Sulphur of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, Diſſolv'd by the Spirit of Wine; if I had leaſure to manifeſt how much Chymiſts are wont to delude themſelves and others by the Ignorance of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes upon whoſe account ſpirit of Wine and other <hi>Menſtruums</hi> may acquire
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:105458:143"/>a red or ſome other high colour. But to returne to our Chymical Oyles, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they were exactly pure; Yet I hope they would be, as the beſt ſpirit of Wine is, but the more infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and deflagrable. And therefore ſince an Oyle can be by the Fire alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turn'd into flame, which is ſomething of a very differing Nature from it: I ſhall Demand how this Oyle can be a Primogeneal and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body, as moſt Chymiſts would have their Principles; Since it is further reſoluble into flame, which whether or no it be a portion of the Element of Fire, as an <hi>Aristotelian</hi> would conclude, is certainly ſomething of a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature from a Chymical Oyle, ſince it burnes, and ſhines, and mounts ſwiftly upwards; none of which a Chymical Oyle does, whilſt it continues ſuch. And if it ſhould be Objected, that the Diſſipated Parts of this flaming Oyle may be caught and collected again into Oyl or Sulphur; I ſhall demand, what Chymiſt appears to have ever done it; and without Examining whether it may not hence be as well ſaid that ſulphur is but compacted Fire, as that Fire is but
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:105458:144"/>diffus'd Sulphur, I ſhall leave you to conſider whether it may not hence be argu'd, that neither Fire nor Sulphur are primitive and indeſtructible Bodies; and I ſhall further obſerve that, at leaſt it will hence appear that a portion of matter may without being Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with new Ingredients, by having the Texture and Motion of its ſmall parts chang'd, be eaſily, by the means of the Fire, endow'd with new Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, more differing from them it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then are thoſe which ſuffice to diſcriminate the Chymiſts Principles from one another.</p>
                  <p>We are next to Conſider, whether in the Anatomy of mixt Bodies, that which Chymiſts call the Mercurial part of them be un-compounded, or no. But to tell You True, though Chymiſts do Unanimouſly affirm that their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſcover a Principle, which they call Mercury, yet I find them to give of it Deſcriptions ſo Differing, and ſo Aenigmaticall, that I, who am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to confeſs that I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is not ſence, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to you that I know not what to make of them. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:105458:144"/>therefore, as you will eaſily believe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Followers, does ſomewhere call that Mercury which aſcends upon the burning of Wood, as the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are wont to take the ſame ſmoke for Air; and ſo ſeems to define Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury by Volatility, or (if I may coyne ſuch a Word) Effumability. But ſince, in this Example, both Volatile Salt and Sulphur make part of the ſmoke, which does indeed conſiſt alſo both of Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and Terrene Corpuſcles, this Notion is not to be admitted; And I find that the more ſober Chymiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſavow it. Yet to ſhew you how little of clearneſs we are to expect in the accounts even of latter <hi>Spagyriſts,</hi> be pleas'd to take notice, that <hi>Beguinus,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his <hi>Tyrocinium Chymicum,</hi> written for the Inſtruction of Novices, when he comes to tell us what are meant by the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> which for their being Principles ought to be defin'd the more accurately and plainly, gives us this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Mercury; <hi>Mercurius</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>est liquor ille acidus, permeabilis,</hi>

For ſcarce telling us any more, then that in all bodies that which is found beſides Salt and Sulphur, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, or, as they call them, Phlegm and Dead Earth, is that Spirit which in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Language may be call'd <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He ſayes that which I confeſs is not at all ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to me, who do not love to ſeem to acquieſce in any mans Myſtical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that I may be thought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
                  <p>If (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) I durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that the ſame thing would be thought clear by me, and thoſe that are fond of ſuch cloudy Expreſſions as You juſtly Tax the Chymiſts for, I ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to offer to Conſideration, whether or no, ſince the Mercurial Principle that ariſes from Diſtillation is unanimouſly aſſerted to be diſtinct from the ſalt and Sulphur of the ſame Concrete, that may not be call'd the Mercury of a Body, which though it aſcend in Diſtillation, as do the Phlegme and Sulphur, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſipid like the former, nor infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:105458:146"/>like the latter. And therefore I would ſubſtitute to the too much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name of Mercury, the more clear and Familiar Appellation of Spirit, which is alſo now very much made uſe of even by the Chymiſts themſelves, of our times, though they have not given us ſo Diſtinct an Explication, as were fit, of what may be call'd the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a mixt Body.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not perhaps (ſayes <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>) much quarrel with your Notion of Mercury. But as for the Chymiſts, what they can mean, with congruity to their own Principles, by the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Animals and Vegetables, 'twill not be ſo eaſie to find out; for they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Taſts only to the Saline Principle, and conſequently would be much put to it to ſhew what Liquor it is, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Bodies, that not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, for that they call Phlegme, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is inflamable as Oyle or Sulphur, nor has any Taſt; which according to them muſt proceed from a Mixture, at leaſt, of Salt. And if we ſhould take Spirit in the ſence of the Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd among Modern Chymiſts and Phyſitians, for any Diſtill'd Liquor that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:105458:146"/>is neither Phlegme nor oyle, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation would yet appear Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough. For, plainly, that which firſt aſcends in the Diſtillation of Wine and Fermented Liquors, is generally as well by Chymiſts as others reputed a Spirit. And yet pure Spirit of Wine being wholly inflamable ought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them to be reckon'd to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous, not the Mercurial Principle. And among the other Liquors that go under the name of Spirits, there are divers which ſeem to belong to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Salts, ſuch as are the Spirits of Nitre, Vitriol, Sea-Salt and others, and even the Spirit of Harts-horn, being, as I have try'd, in great part, if not totally reducible into Salt and Phlegme, may be ſuſpected to be but a Volatile Salt disguis'd by the Phlegme mingl'd with it into the forme of a Liquor. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if this be a Spirit, it manifeſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers very much from that of Vinager, the Taſt of the one being Acid, and the other Salt, and their Mixture in caſe they be very pure, ſometimes occaſioning an Efferveſcence like that of thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors the Chymiſts count moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to one another. And even among
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:105458:147"/>thoſe Liquors that ſeem to have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter title then thoſe hitherto mention'd, to the name of Spirits, there appears a ſenſible Diverſity; For ſpirit of Oak, for inſtance, differs from that of Tartar, and this from that of Box, or of <hi>Guaiacum.</hi> And in ſhort, even theſe ſpirits as well as other Diſtill'd Liquors manifeſt a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity betwixt themſelves, either in their Actions on our ſenſes, or in their other operations.</p>
                  <p>And (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) beſides this Diſparity that is to be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Liquors that the Modernes call ſpirits, &amp; take for ſimilar bodies, what I have formerly told you concerning the Spirit of Box-wood may let you ſee that ſome of thoſe Liquors not only have qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities very differing from others, but may be further reſolved into ſubſtances differing from one another.</p>
                  <p>And ſince many moderne Chymiſts and other Naturaliſts are pleaſed to take the Mercurial ſpirit of Bodies for the ſame Principle, under differing names, I muſt invite you to obſerve, with me, the great difference that is conſpicuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt all the Vegetable and Animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits I have mention'd and running
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:105458:147"/>Mercury. I ſpeak not of that which is commonly ſold in ſhops that many of themſelves will confeſſe to be a mixt Body; but of that which is ſeparated from Metals, which by ſome Chymiſts that ſeem more Philoſophers then the reſt, and eſpecially by the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Claveus,</hi> is (for diſtinction ſake) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mercurius Corporum.</hi> Now this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Liquor being one of thoſe three Principles of which Mineral Bodies are by <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> affirmed to be compos'd and to be reſoluble into them, the many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Differences betwixt them and the Mercuries, as They call Them, of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables and Animals will allow me to inferr, either that Minerals and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two ſorts of Mixt Bodies conſiſt not of the ſame Elements, or that thoſe Principles whereinto Minerals are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſolved, which Chymiſts with great oſtentation ſhew us as the true principles, of them, are but Secundary Principles, or Mixts of a peculiar ſort, which muſt be themſelves reduc'd to a very differing forme, to be of the ſame kind with Vegetable and Animal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all; for although I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:105458:148"/>told You how Little Credit there is to be given to the Chymical Proceſſes commonly to be met with, of Extracting the Mercuries of Metals, Yet I will now add, that ſuppoſing that the more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious of Them do not untruly affirme that they have really drawn true and running Mercury from ſeveral Metals (which I wiſh they had cleerly taught Us how to do alſo,) yet it may be ſtill doubted whether ſuch extracted Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do not as well differ from common Quickſilver, and from one another, as from the Mercuries of Vegetables and Animalls. <hi>Claveus,</hi> in his Apology, ſpeaking of ſome <hi>experiments</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Metalline Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies may be fixt into the nobler me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:105458:148"/>And elſewhere, in the ſame Book, he tells us, that he himſelf tryed, that by bare coction the quickſilver of Tin or Pewter <hi>(argen um vivum ex ſtanno prolicitum)</hi> may by an efficient cauſe, as he ſpeaks, be turn'd into pure Gold.

And being by me demanded whether or no any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercury would not as well have been changed by the ſame Operations, he aſſured me of the Negative.</p>
                  <p>And ſince I am fallen upon the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mercuries of metals, you will perhaps expect <hi>(Eleutherius!)</hi> that I ſhould ſay ſomething of their two other principles; but I muſt freely confeſs to you, that what Diſparity there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:105458:149"/>the ſalts and ſulphurs of Metals and other Menerals, I am not my ſelf experienced enough in the ſeparations and examens of them, to venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: (for as for the ſalts of Metals, I formerly repreſented it as a thing much to be queſtion'd, whether they have any at all:) And for the proceſſes of ſeparation I find in Authors, if they were (what many of them are not) ſucceſsfully practicable, as I noted above, yet they are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the aſſiſtance of other bodies, ſo hardly, if upon any termes at all, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from them, that it is very difficult to give the ſeparated principles all their due, and no more. But the Sulphur of Antimony which is vehemently vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the ſtrongly ſcented Anodyne Sulphur of Vitriol inclines me to think that not only Mineral Sulphurs differ from Vegetable ones, but alſo from one another, retaining much of the nature of their Concretes. The ſalts of metals, and of ſome ſort of minerals, You will eaſily gueſſe by the Doubts I formerly expreſs'd, whether metals have any ſalt at all, that I have not been ſo happy as yet to ſee, perhaps not for want of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.

But becauſe in divers other places of his writings he ſeems to talk at a differing rate of the three Principles and the four Elements, I ſhall content my ſelf to inferr from the alledg'd paſſage, that if his doctrine be not conſiſtent with that Part of mine which it is brought to countenance, it is very difficult to know what his opinion concerning ſalt, ſulphur and mercury, was; and that conſequently we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about the beginning of our conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to decline taking upon us, either to examine or oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether I ſhould on this occaſion add, that thoſe very bodies the Chymiſts call Phlegme and Earth do yet recede from an Elementary ſimplicity.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:105458:150"/>That common Earth and Water fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently do ſo, notwithſtanding the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary opinion, is not deny'd by the more wary of the moderne Peripateticks themſelves: and certainly, moſt Earths are much leſſe ſimple bodies then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined even by Chymiſts, who do not ſo conſideratly to preſcribe and employ Earths Promiſcuouſly in thoſe diſtillations that require the mixture of ſome <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> to hinder the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the matter, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its groſſer parts. For I have found ſome Earths to yield by diſtillation a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor very far from being inodorous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid; and 'tis a known obſervation, that moſt kinds of fat Earth kept cover'd from the rain, and hindred from ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the production of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, will in time become impregnated with Salt-Petre.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt remember that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Earths I ought here to ſpeak of, are ſuch as are ſeparated from mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the fire; and therefore to reſtrain my Diſcourſe to ſuch, I ſhall tell you, That we ſee the Phlegme of Vitriol (for inſtance) is a very effectual remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt burnes; and I know a very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:105458:151"/>and experienc'd <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected ſecret (himſelf confeſs'd to me) it is, for the diſcuſſing of hard and Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Tumours. The Phlegme of Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though drawn exceeding leaſurly in a digeſting Furnace, I have purpoſely made tryall of; and ſometimes found it able to draw, though ſlowly, a ſaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſweetneſs out of Lead; and as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member by long Digeſtion, I diſſolv'd Corpals in it. The Phlegme of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Saturne is ſaid to have very pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar properties. Divers Eminent Chymiſts teach, that it will diſſolve Pearls, which being precipitated by the ſpirit of the ſame concrete are thereby (as they ſay) rendred volatile; which has been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, upon his own obſervation, by a perſon of great veracity. The Phlegme of Wine, and indeed divers other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that are indiſcriminately condemnd to be caſt away as phlegm, are endow'd with qualities that make them differ both from meer water, and from each other; and whereas the Chymiſts are pleas'd to call the <hi>caput mortuum</hi> of what they have diſtill'd (after they have by affuſion of water drawn away its ſalt) <hi>terra damnata,</hi> or Earth, it may be doubted whether or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:105458:151"/>no thoſe earths are all of them perfectly alike: and it is ſcarce to be doubted, but that there are ſome of them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet unreduc'd to an Elementary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The aſhes of wood depriv'd of all the ſalt, and bone-Aſhes, or calcin'd Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, which Refiners chooſe to make Teſts of, as freeſt from Salt, ſeem unlike: and he that ſhall compare either of theſe inſipid aſhes to Lime, and much more to the <hi>calx</hi> of Talk (though by the affuſion of water they be exquiſitely dulcify'd) will perhaps ſee cauſe to think them things of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing nature. And it is evident in Colcothar that the exacteſt calcination, follow'd by an exquiſite dulcification, does not alwaies reduce the remaining bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into elementary earth; for after the ſalt or Vitriol (if the Calcination have been too faint) is drawn out of the Colcothar, the reſidue is not earth, but a mixt body, rich in Medical vertues (as experience has inform'd me) and which <hi>Angelus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> affirmes to be partly reducible into malleable Copper; which I judge very probable: for though when I was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Experiments upon Colcothar, I was deſtitute of a Furnace capable of giving a heat intenſe Enough to bring ſuch a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:105458:152"/>Calx to Fuſion; yet having conjectur'd that if Colcothar abounded with that Metal, Aqua Fortis would find it out there, I put ſome dulcifi'd Colcothar into that <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and found the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, according to my Expectation, preſently Colour'd as Highly as if it had been an Ordinary Solution of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                  <p>If you remember (replies <hi>Carneades</hi>) that at the Beginning of our Conference with <hi>Philoponus,</hi> I declar'd to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the Company, that I would not <hi>engage</hi> my ſelf at preſent to do any more then examine the uſual proofs alledg'd by Chymiſts, for the Vulgar doctrine of their three Hypoſtatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; You will eaſily perceive that I am not oblig'd to make anſwer to what you newly propos'd; and that it rather grants, then diſproves what I have been contending for: Since by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make ſo great a change in the reputed Principles that Deſtillation affords the common <hi>Spagyriſts,</hi> 'tis plainly enough preſuppos'd, that before ſuch Artificial Depurations be made, the Subſtances to be made more ſimple were not yet ſimple enough to be look'd upon as Elementary; Wherefore in caſe the <hi>Artiſts</hi> you ſpeak of could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they give out they can, yet I ſhould not need to be aſham'd of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving queſtion'd the Vulgar Opinion
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:105458:153"/>touching the <hi>tria Prima.</hi> And as to the thing it ſelf, I ſhall freely acknowledge to you, that I love not to be forward in determining things to be impoſſible, till I know and have conſider'd the means by which they are propos'd to be effected. And therefore I ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny either the poſſibility of what theſe <hi>Artiſts</hi> promiſe, or my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any juſt Inference; however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to my Conjectures, that may be drawn from their performances. But give me leave to tell you withall, that becauſe ſuch promiſes are wont (as Experience has more then once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me) to be much more eaſily made, then made good by Chymiſts, I muſt withhold my Beliefe from their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, till their Experiments exact it; and muſt not be ſo eaſie as to expect before hand, an unlikely thing upon no ſtronger Inducements then are yet given me: Beſides that I have not yet found by what I have heard of theſe Artiſts, that though they pretend to bring the ſeveral Subſtances into which the Fire has divided the Concrete, to an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſimplicity, They pretend alſo to be able by the Fire to divide all Concretes,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:105458:154"/>Minerals, and others, into the ſame number of Diſtinct Subſtances. And in the mean time I muſt think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that they can either truly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate as many differing Bodies from Gold (for Inſtance) or <hi>Oſteocolla,</hi> as we can do from Wine, or Vitriol; or that the Mercury (for Example) of Gold or Saturn would be perfectly of the ſame Nature with that of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn; and that the ſulphur of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be but Numerically different from the Diſtill'd butter or oyle of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) that you ſhould meet with Chymiſts, who would allow you to take in Earth and Water into the number of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Mixt Bodies; and being alſo content to change the Ambiguous Name of Mercury for that more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible one of ſpirit, ſhould conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make the principles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies to be Five; would you not think it ſomething hard to reject ſo plauſible an Opinion, only becauſe the Five ſubſtances into which the Fire divides mixt Bodies are not exactly pure, and Homogeneous? For my part
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:105458:154"/>(Continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) I cannot but think it ſomewhat ſtrange, in caſe this Opinion be not true, that it ſhould fall out ſo luckily, that ſo great a Variety of Bodies ſhould be Analyz'd by the Fire into juſt five Diſtinct ſubſtances; which ſo little differing from the Bodies that bear thoſe names, may ſo Plauſibly be call'd Oyle, Spirit, Salt, Water, and Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Opinion You now propoſe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Carneades</hi>) being another then that I was engag'd to examine, it is not requiſite for me to Debate it at preſent; nor ſhould I have leiſure to do it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. Wherefore I ſhall only tell you in General, that though I think this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in ſome reſpects more defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then that of the Vulgar Chymiſts; yet you may eaſily enough learn from the paſt Diſcourſe what may be thought of it: Since many of the Objections made againſt the Vulgar Doctrine of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts ſeem, without much alteration, employable againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> alſo. For, beſides that this Doctrine does as well as the other take it for granted, (what is not eaſie to be prov'd) that the Fire is the true and Adequate Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyzer
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:105458:155"/>of Bodies, and that all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſubſtances obtainable from a mixt Body by the Fire, were ſo pre-exiſtent in it, that they were but extricated from each other by the <hi>Analyſis;</hi> Beſides that this Opinion, too, aſcribe to the Productions of the Fire an Elementary ſimplicity, which I have ſhewn not to belong to them; and beſides that this Doctrine is lyable to ſome of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Difficulties, wherewith That of the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> is incumber'd; Beſides all this, I ſay, this quinary number of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, (if you pardon the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ought at leaſt to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to the Generality of Animal and Vegetable Bodies, ſince not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe there are ſome Bodies (as I formerly argu'd) which, for ought has yet been made to appear, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, either of fewer or more ſimilar ſubſtances then preciſely Five. But in the Mineral Kingdom, there is ſcarce one Concrete that has been evinc'd to be adequatly diviſible into ſuch five Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Elements, and neither more nor leſs, as this Opinion would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mixt Body to conſiſt of.</p>
                  <p>And this very thing (continues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>)
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:105458:155"/>may ſerve to take away or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your Wonder, that juſt ſo many Bodies as five ſhould be found upon the Reſolution of Concretes. For ſince we find not that the fire can make any ſuch <hi>Analyſis</hi> (into five Elements) of Metals and other Mineral Bodies, whoſe Texture is more ſtrong and permanent, it remains that the Five Subſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration be Obtain'd from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable and Animal Bodies, which (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably by reaſon of their looſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture) are capable of being Diſtill'd. And as to ſuch Bodies, 'tis natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that, whether we ſuppoſe that there are, or are not, preciſely five E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, there ſhould ordinarily occurr in the Diſſipated parts a five Fold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Scheme (if I may ſo ſpeak.) For if the Parts do not remain all fix'd, as in Gold, Calcin'd Talck, &amp;c. nor all aſcend, as in the Sublimation of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Camphire, &amp;c. but after their Diſſipation do aſſociate themſelves into new Schemes of Matter; it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they will by the Fire be divided into fix'd and Volatile (I mean, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that degree of heat by which they are deſtill'd) and thoſe Volatile
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:105458:156"/>parts will, for the moſt part, aſcend either in a dry forme, which Chymiſts are pleas'd to call, if they be Taſtleſs, Flowers; if Sapid, Volatile Salt; or in a Liquid Forme. And this Liquor muſt be either inflamable, and ſo paſs for oyl, or not inflamable, and yet ſubtile and pungent, which may be call'd Spirit; or elſe ſtrengthleſs or inſipid, which may be nam'd Phlegme, or Water. And as for the fixt part, or <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> it will moſt commonly conſiſt of Corpuſcles, partly Soluble in Water, or Sapid, (eſpecially if the Saline parts were not ſo Volatile, as to fly away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which make up its fixt ſalt; and partly inſoluble and inſipid, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeems to challenge the name of Earth. But although upon this ground one might eaſily enough have foretold, that the differing ſubſtances obtain'd from a perfectly mixt Body by the Fire would for the moſt part be reducible to the five newly mentioned States of Matter; yet it will not preſently follow, that theſe five Diſtinct ſubſtances were ſimple and primogeneal bodies, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent in the Concrete that the fire does but take them aſunder. Beſides
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:105458:156"/>that it does not appear, that all Mixt Bodies, (witneſs, Gold, Silver, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c.) Nay nor perhaps all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, which may appear by what we ſaid above of <hi>Camphire, Benzoin,</hi> &amp;c. are reſoluble by Fire into juſt ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Schemes of Matter. Nor will the Experiments formerly alledg'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to look upon theſe ſeparated Subſtances as Elementary, or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Neither will it be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Argument of their being Bodies that deſerve the Names which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are pleas'd to give them, that they have an Analogy in point of Conſiſtence, or either Volatility or Fixtneſs, or elſe ſome other obvious Quality, with the ſuppos'd Principles, whoſe names are aſcrib'd to them. For, as I told you above, notwithſtanding this Reſemblance in ſome one Quality, there may be ſuch a Diſparity in others, as may be more fit to give them Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Appellations, then the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is to give them one and the ſame. And indeed it ſeems but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a groſs Way of judging of the Nature of Bodies, to conclude without Scruple, that thoſe muſt be of the ſame
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:105458:157"/>Nature that agree in ſome ſuch Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quality, as Fluidity, Dryneſs, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, and the like: ſince each of thoſe Qualities, or States of Matter, may Comprehend a great Variety of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, otherwiſe of a very differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as we may ſee in the Calxes of Gold, of Vitriol, and of Venetian Talck, compar'd with common Aſhes, which yet are very dry, and fix'd by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of the Fire, as well as they. And as we may likewiſe gather from what I have formerly Obſerv'd, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of Box-Wood, which though a Volatile, Sapid, and not infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Liquor, as well as the Spirits of Harts-horn, of Blood and others, (and therefore has been hitherto call'd, the Spirit, and eſteem'd for one of the Principles of the Wood that affords it;) may yet, as I told You, be ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Liquors, differing from one another, and one of them at leaſt, from the Generality of other Chymical Spirits.</p>
                  <p>But you may your ſelf, if you pleaſe, (purſues <hi>Carneades</hi>) accommodate to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> you propos'd what other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars you ſhall think applicable to it,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105458:157"/>in the foregoing Diſcourſe. For I think it unſeaſonable for me to meddle now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further with a Controverſie, which ſince it does not now belong to me, Leaves me at Liberty to Take my Own time to Declare my Self about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleutherius</hi> perceiving that <hi>Carneades</hi> was ſomewhat unwilling to ſpend any more time upon the debate of this Opinion, and having perhaps ſome thoughts of taking hence a Riſe to make him Diſcourſe it more fully another time, thought not fit as then to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention to him of the propos'd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but told him;</p>
                  <p>I preſume I need not mind you, <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> That both the Patrons of the ternary number of Principles, and thoſe that would have five Elements, endeavour to back their experiments with a ſpecious Reaſon or two; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſome of thoſe Embracers of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion laſt nam'd (whom I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with, and found them Learned men) aſſigne this Reaſon of the neceſſity of five diſtinct Elements; that otherwiſe mixt Bodies could not be ſo compounded and temper'd as to obtain a due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:105458:158"/>and competent Duration. For Salt (ſay they) is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of Solidity; and Permanency in Compound Bodies, without which the other four Elements might indeed be variouſly and looſly blended together, but would remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compacted; but that Salt might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into minute Parts, and convey'd to the other Subſtances to be compacted by it, and with it, there is a Neceſſity of Water. And that the mixture may not be too hard and brittle, a Sulphureous or Oyly Principle muſt intervene to make the maſs more tenacious; to this a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ſpirit muſt be ſuperadded; which by its activity may for a while premeate, and as it were leaven the whole Maſs, and thereby promote the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite mixture and incorporation of the Ingredients. To all which (laſtly) a portion of Earth muſt be added, which by its drineſſe and poracity may ſoak up part of that water wherein the Salt was diſſolv'd, and eminently concurr with the other ingredients to give the whole body the requiſite conſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>I perceive (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi> ſmiling) that if it be true, as 'twas lately rooted from the Proverb, <hi>That good Wits have
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:105458:158"/>bad Memories,</hi> You have that Title, as well as a better, to a place among the good Wits. For you have already more then once forgot, that I declar'd to you that I would at this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Examine only the Experiments of my Adverſaries, not their Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reaſons. Yet 'tis not (Subjoynes <hi>Carneades</hi>) for fear of medling with the Argument you have propos'd, that I decline the examining it at preſent. For if when we are more at leaſure, you ſhall have a mind that we may So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conſider of it together; I am confident we ſhall ſcarce find it inſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And in the mean time we may obſerve, that ſuch a way of Arguing may, it ſeems, be ſpeciouſly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to differing <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> For I find that <hi>Beguinus,</hi> and other Aſſertors of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> pretend to make out by ſuch a way, the requiſiteneſs of their Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, to conſtitute mixt Bodies, without taking notice of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an Addition of Water and Earth.</p>
                  <p>And indeed neither ſort of Chymiſts ſeem to have duly conſider'd how great Variety there is in the Textures and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:105458:159"/>Conſiſtences of Compound Bodie; sand how little the conſiſtence and Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many of them ſeem to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and be explicable by the propos'd Notion. And not to mention thoſe almoſt incorruptible Subſtances obtainable by the Fire, which I have prov'd to be ſomewhat compounded, and which the Chymiſts will readily grant not to be perfectly mixt Bodies: (Not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe, I ſay) If you will but recall to mind ſome of thoſe Experiments, whereby I ſhew'd You that out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water only mixt Bodies (and even living ones) of very differing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences, and reſoluble by Fire into as many Principles as other bodies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be perfectly mixt; if you do this, I ſay, you will not, I ſuppoſe, be averſe from beleeving, that Nature by a convenient diſpoſition of the minute parts of a portion of matter may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive bodies durable enough, and of this, or that, or the other Conſiſtence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being oblig'd to make uſe of all, much leſs of any Determinate quantity of each of the five Elements, or of the three Principles to compound ſuch bodies of. And I have (purſues <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>)
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:105458:159"/>ſomething wonder'd, Chymiſts ſhould not conſider, that there is ſcarce any body in Nature ſo permanent and indiſſoluble as Glaſs; which yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves teach us may be made of bare Aſhes, brought to fuſion by the meer Violence of the Fire; ſo that, ſince Aſhes are granted to conſiſt but of pure Salt and ſimple Earth, ſequeſtred from all the other Principles or Elements, they muſt acknowledge, That even Art it ſelf can of two Elements only, or, if you pleaſe, one Principle and one Element, compound a Body more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then almoſt any in the World. Which being undeniable, how will they prove that Nature cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Mixt Bodies, and even durable Ones, under all the five Elements or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Principles.</p>
                  <p>But to inſiſt any longer on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Diſquiſition, Touching their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that would Eſtabliſh five Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were to remember as little as You did before, that the Debate of this matter is no part of my firſt undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and conſequently, that I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpent time enough in what I look back upon but as a digreſſion, or at beſt an Excurſion.</p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:105458:160"/>
                  <p>And thus, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) having at length gone through the four Conſiderations I propos'd to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto you, I hold it not unfit, for fear my having inſiſted ſo long on each of them may have made you forget their <hi>Series,</hi> briefly to repeat them by telling you, that</p>
                  <p>Since, in the firſt place, it may juſtly be doubted whether or no the Fire be, as Chymiſts ſuppoſe it, the genuine and Univerſal Reſolver of mixt Bodies;</p>
                  <p>Since we may doubt, in the next place, whether or no all the Diſtinct Subſtances that may be obtain'd from a mixt body by the Fire were pre-exiſtent there in the formes in which they were ſeparated from it;</p>
                  <p>Since alſo, though we ſhould grant the Subſtances ſeparable from mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the fire to have been their component Ingredients, yet the Number of ſuch ſubſtances does not appear the ſame in all mixt Bodies; ſome of them being Reſoluble into more differing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than three, and Others not being Reſoluble into ſo many as three.</p>
                  <p>And Since, Laſtly, thoſe very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are thus ſeparated are not for the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105458:160"/>moſt part pure and Elementary bodies, but new kinds of mixts;</p>
                  <p>Since, I ſay, theſe things are ſo, I hope you will allow me to inferr, that the Vulgar Experiments (I might perchance have Added, the Arguments too) wont to be Alledg'd by Chymiſts to prove, that their three Hypoſtatical Principles do adequately compoſe all mixt Bodies, are not ſo demonſtrative as to reduce a wary Perſon to acquieſce in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which, till they Explain and prove it better, will by its perplexing darkneſs be more apt to puzzle then ſatisfy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering men, and will to them appear incumbred with no ſmall Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>And from what has been hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) we may Learn, what to Judge of the common Practice of thoſe Chymiſts, who becauſe they have found that Diverſe compound Bodies (for it will not hold in All) can be reſolv'd into, or rather can be brought to afford two or three differing Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more then the Soot and Aſhes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the naked fire commonly divides them in our Chymnies, cry up their own Sect for the Invention of a New Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, ſome of them, as <hi>Helmont, &amp;c.</hi> ſtyling
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:105458:161"/>themſelves Philoſophers by the Fire; and the moſt part not only aſcribing, but as far as in them lies, engroſſing to thoſe of their Sect the Title of PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS.</p>
                  <p>But alas, how narrow is this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that reaches but to ſome of thoſe compound Bodies, which we find but upon, or in the cruſt or outſide of our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe, which is it ſelf but a point in compariſon of the vaſt extended Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, of whoſe other and greater parts the Doctrine of the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> does not give us an Account! For what does it teach us, either of the Nature of the Sun, which Aſtronomers affirme to be eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and odd times bigger then the whole Earth? or of that of thoſe numerous ſixt Starrs, which, for ought we know, would very few, if any of them, appear inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in bulke and brightneſs to the Sun, if they were as neer us as He? What does the knowing that Salt, ſulphur and Mercury, are the Principles of Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, informe us of the Nature of that vaſt, fluid, and Aetherial Subſtance, that ſeemes to make up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtellar, and conſequently much the greateſt part of the World? for as for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105458:161"/>the opinion commonly aſcrib'd to <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus,</hi> as if he would have not only the four Peripatetick Elements, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Celeſtial parts of the Univerſe to conſiſt of his three Principles, ſince the modern Chymiſts themſelves have not thought ſo groundleſs a conceit worth their owning, I ſhall not think it Worth my confuting.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould perchance forgive the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis I have been all this while exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, if, though it reaches but to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little part of the World, it did at leaſt give us a ſatisfactory account of thoſe things to which 'tis ſaid to reach. But I find not, that it gives us any other then a very imperfect information even about mixt Bodies themſelves: For how will the knowledge of the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us the Reaſon, why the Loadſtone drawes a Needle and diſpoſes it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Poles, and yet ſeldom preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points at them? how will this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis teach Us how a Chick is formed in the Egge, or how the Seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Mint, Pompions, and other Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables, that I mention'd to You above, can faſhion Water into Various Plants, each of them endow'd with its peculiar
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:105458:162"/>and determinate ſhape, and with divers ſpecifick and diſcriminating Qualities? How does this Hypotheſis ſhew us, how much Salt, how much Sulphur, and how much Mereury muſt be taken to make a Chick or a Pompion? and if We know that, what Principle is it, that manages theſe Ingredients, and contrives (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) ſuch Liquors as the White and Yelk of an Egge into ſuch a variety of Textures as is requiſite to faſhion the Bones, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Feathers, Blood, and other parts of a Chick; and not only to faſhion each Limbe, but to connect them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after that manner that is moſt congruous to the perfection of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal which is to Conſiſt of Them? For to ſay, that ſome more fine and ſubtile part of either or all the Hypoſtatical Principles is the Director in all this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Architect of all this Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtructure, is to give one occaſion to demand again, what proportion and way of mixture of the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Architectonick</hi> Spirit, and what Agent made ſo skilful and happy a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And the Anſwer to this Queſtion, if the Chymiſts will keep themſelves

And if it were not to intrench upon the Theame of a Friend of ours here preſent, I could eaſily proſecute the Imperfections of the Vulgar Chymiſts Philoſophy, and ſhew you, that by going about to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by their three Principles, I ſay not, all the abſtruſe Properties of mixt Bodies, but even ſuch Obvious and more familiar <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as <hi>Fluidity</hi> and <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> The Colours and Figures of Stones, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and other compound Bodies, The Nutrition of either Plants or Animals, the Gravity of Gold or Quickſilver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Wine or Spirit of Wine; By attempting, I ſay, to render a reaſon of theſe (to omit a thouſand others as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to account for) from any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three ſimple Ingredients, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts will be much more likely to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit themſelves and their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> then ſatisfy an intelligent Inquirer after Truth.</p>
                  <p>But (interpoſes <hi>Eleutherus</hi>) This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſeems no more then may be made againſt the four Peripatetick Elements. And indeed almoſt againſt any other <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi>

And This, ſayes he, is chiefly Apparent, when we Inquire into the Properties and Faculties of Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. And I know (continues <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>) That the Perſon You have aſſum'd, of an Opponent of the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Doctrine,</hi> will not ſo far prevaile againſt your Native and wonted Equity, as To keep You from acknowledging that Philoſophy is much beholden to the Notions and Diſcoveries of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</p>
                  <p>If the Chymiſts You ſpeak of (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes <hi>Carneades</hi>) had been ſo modeſt, or ſo Diſcreet, as to propoſe their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105458:163"/>of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> but as a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uſeful among Others, to increaſe Humane knowledge, they had deſerv'd more of our thanks; and leſs of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but ſince the Thing that they pretend is not ſo much to contribute a Notion toward the Improvement of Philoſophy, as to make this Notion at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a few leſſe conſiderable ones) paſs for a New Philoſophy it ſelf. Nay, ſince they boaſt ſo much of this phancie of theirs, that the famous <hi>Quercetanus</hi> ſcruples not to write, that if his moſt certain Doctrine of the three Principles were ſufficiently Learned, Examin'd, and Cultivated, it would eaſily Diſpel all the Darkneſs that benights our minds, and bring in a Clear Light, that would remove all Difficulties. This School af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording Theorems and Axiomes irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, and to be admitted without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by impartial Judges; and ſo uſeful withal, as to exempt us from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having recourſe, for want of the knowledg of cauſes, to that Sanctuary of the igorant, Occult Qualities; ſince, I ſay, this Domeſtick Notion of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts is ſo much overvalued by them, I cannot think it unfit, they ſhould be made
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105458:164"/>ſenſible of their miſtake; and be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd to take in more fruitful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Principles, if they mean to give us an account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature; and not confine themſelves and (as far as they can) others to ſuch narrow Principles, as I fear will ſcarce inable them to give an account (I mean an intelligible one) of the tenth part (I ſay not) of all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature; but even of all ſuch as by the <hi>Leucippian</hi> or ſome of the other ſorts of Principles may be plauſibly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated. And though I be not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant, that the incompetency I impute to the Chymical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is but the ſame which may be Objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of the four Elements, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Doctrines that have been maintain'd by Learnedmen; yet ſince 'tis the Chymical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> only which I am now examining, I ſee not why, if what I impute to it be a real inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, either it ſhould ceaſe to be ſo, or I ſhould ſcruple to object it, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Theories are lyable thereunto, as well as the Hermetical. For I know not why a Truth ſhould be thought leſſe a Truth for the being fit to overthrow variety of Errors.</p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:105458:164"/>
                  <p>I am oblig'd to You (continues <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> a little ſmiling) for the favourable Opinion You are pleas'd to expreſs of my Equity, if there be no deſign in it. But I need not be tempted by an Artifice, or invited by a Complement, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the great ſervice that the Labours of Chymiſts have done the Lovers of uſeful Learning; nor even on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall their Arrogance hinder my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But ſince we are as well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the truth of their Doctrine as the merit of their induſtry, I muſt in order to the inveſtigation of the firſt, continue a reply, to talk at the rate of the part I have aſſum'd; And tell you, that when I acknowledg the uſefulneſs of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> to Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, I do it upon the ſcore of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, not upon that of Their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; for it ſeems to me, that their Writings, as their Furnaces, afford as well ſmoke as light; and do little leſſe obſcure ſome ſubjects, then they illuſtrate others. And though I am unwilling to deny, that 'tis difficult for a man to be an Accompliſht Naturaliſt, that is a ſtranger to Chymiſtry, yet I look upon the common Operations and practices
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105458:165"/>of Chymiſts, almoſt as I do on the Letters of the Alphabet, without whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge 'tis very hard for a man to become a Philoſopher; and yet that knowledge is very far from being ſufficient to make him One.</p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> reſuming a more ſerious Look) to conſider a little more particularly what you alledg in favour of the Chymical Doctrine of the <hi>Tria Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> though I ſhall readily acknowledge it not to be unuſeful, and that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and Embracers of it have done the Common-Wealth of Learning ſome ſervice, by helping to deſtroy that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive eſteem, or rather veneration, wherewith the Doctrine of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was almoſt as generally as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly entertain'd; yet what has been alledg'd concerning the uſefulneſs of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> ſeems to me liable to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as for the very way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which the more Learned and more Sober Champions of the Chymical cauſe employ to evince the Chymical Principles in Mixt Bodies, it ſeems to me to be farr enough from being convincing. This grand and leading Argument, your

                     <hi>Sennertus</hi> Himſelf, who layes Great weight upon it, and tells us, that the moſt Learned Philoſophers employ this way of Reaſoning to prove the moſt important things, propoſes thus: <hi>Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>pluribus eaedem affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones &amp; qualitates inſunt, per commune quoddam Principium inſint neceſſe eſt, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut omnia ſunt Gravia propter terram, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida propter Ignem.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the Recital of this Argument, (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) I therefore thought fit to retain the Language wherein the Author propoſes it, that I might alſo retain the propriety of ſome Latine Termes, to which I do not readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any that fully anſwer in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. But as for the Argumentation it ſelf, 'tis built upon a precarious ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that ſeems to me neither De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable nor true; for, how does it
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105458:166"/>appear, that where the ſame Quality is to be met with in many Bodies, it muſt belong to them upon the Account of ſome one Body whereof they all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take? (For that the Major of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Argument is to be Underſtood of the Material Ingredients of bodies, appears by the Inſtances of Earth and Fire he annexes to explain it.) For to begin with that very Example which he is pleas'd to alledge for himſelf; how can he prove, that the Gravity of all Bodies proceeds from what they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the Element of Earth? Since we ſee, that not only common Water, but the more pure Diſtill'd Rain Water is heavy; and Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is much heavier than Earth it ſelf; though none of my Adverſaries has yet prov'd, that it contains any of that Element. And I the Rather make uſe of this Example of Quickſilver, becauſe I ſee not how the Aſſertors of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements will give any better Account of it then the Chymiſts. For if it be demanded how it comes to be Fluid, they will anſwer, that it participates much of the Nature of Water. And indeed, according to them, Water
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105458:166"/>may be the Predominant Element in it, ſince we ſee, that ſeveral Bodies which by Diſtillation afford Liquors that weigh more then their <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> do not yet conſiſt of Liquor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be Fluid. Yet if it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how Quickſilver comes to be ſo heavy, then 'tis reply'd, that 'tis by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Earth that abounds in it; but ſince, according to them, it muſt conſiſt alſo of air, and partly of Fire, which they affirm to be light Elements, how comes it that it ſhould be ſo much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier then Earth of the ſame bulk, though to fill up the poroſities and other Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it be made up into a maſs or paſte with Water, which it ſelf they allow to be a heavy Element. But to returne to our <hi>Spagyrists,</hi> we ſee that Chymical Oyles and fixt Salts, though never ſo exquiſitely purify'd and freed from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial parts, do yet remain ponderous enough. And Experience has inform'd me, that a pound, for inſtance, of ſome of the heavieſt Woods, as <hi>Guajacum</hi> that will ſink in Water, being burnt to Aſhes will yield a much leſs weight of them (whereof I found but a ſmall part to be Alcalyzate) then much ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:105458:167"/>Vegetables: As alſo that the black Charcoal of it will not ſink as did the wood, but ſwim; which argues that the Differing Gravity of Bodies proceeds chiefly from their particular Texture, as is manifeſt in Gold, the cloſeſt and Compacteſt of Bodies, which is many times heavier then we can poſſibly make any parcell of Earth of the ſame Bulk. I will not examine, what may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd touching the Gravity or Quality Analagous thereunto, of even Celeſtial bodies, from the motion of the ſpots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun, d from the appearing equality of the ſuppos'd Seas in the Moon; nor conſider how little thoſe <hi>Phaemonea</hi> would agree with what <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> preſumes concerning Gravity. But further to invalidate his ſuppoſition, I ſhall demand, upon what Chymical Principle Fluidity depends? And yet Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity is, two or three perhaps excepted, the moſt diffuſed quality of the univerſe, and far more General then almoſt any other of thoſe that are to be met with in any of the Chymicall Principles, or <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Elements; ſince not only the Air, but that vaſt expanſion we call Heaven, in compariſon of which
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105458:167"/>our Terreſtrial Globe (ſuppoſing it were all Solid) is but a point; and perhaps to the Sun and the fixt Stars are fluid bodies. I demand alſo, from which of the Chymical Principles Motion flowes; which yet is an affection of matter much more General then any that can be deduc'd from any of the three Chymical Principles. I might ask the like Queſtion concerning Light, which is not only to be found in the Kindl'd Sulphur of mixt Bodis, but (not to mention thoſe ſorts of rotten Woods, and rotten Fiſh that ſhine in the Dark) in the tails of living Glow-wormes, and in the Vaſt bodies of the Sun and Stars. I would gladly alſo know, in which of the three Principles the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, we call Sound, reſides as in its proper Subject; ſince either Oyl fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Oyle, or Spirit upon Spirit, or Salt upon Salt, in a great quantity, and from a conſiderable height, will make a noiſe, or if you pleaſe, create a ſound, and (that the objection may reach the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi>) ſo will alſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon water, and Earth upon Earth. And I could name other qualities to be met within divers bodies, of which I
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105458:168"/>ſuppoſe my Adverſaries will not in haſte aſſign any Subject, upon whoſe Account it muſt needs be, that the quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all the other ſeveral bodies.</p>
                  <p>And, before I proceed any further, I muſt here invite you to compare the ſuppoſition we are examining, with ſome other of the Chymical Tenents. For, firſt they do in effect teach that more then one quality may belong to, and be deduc'd from, one Principle. For, they aſcribe to Salt Taſts, and the power of Coagulation; to ſulphur, as well Odours as inflamableneſs; And ſome of them aſcribe to Mercury, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; as all of them do effumability, as they ſpeak. And on the other ſide, it is evident that Volatility belongs in common to all the three Principles, and to Water too. For 'tis manifeſt, that Chymical Oyles are Volatile; That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo divers Salts Emerging, upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis of many Concretes, are very Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, is plain from the figitiveneſs of Salt, of Harts-horne, fleſh, &amp;c. aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Diſtillation of thoſe bodies. How eaſily water may be made to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in Vapours, there is ſcarce any body that has not obſerv'd. And as
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:105458:168"/>for what they call the Mercuriall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of bodies, that is ſo apt to be rais'd in the form of Steam, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and others define it by that aptneſs to fly up; ſo that (to draw that inference by the way) it ſeems not that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have been accurate in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of qualities, and their reſpective Principles, ſince they both derive ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualities from the ſame Principle, and muſt aſcribe the ſame quality to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their Principles and other bodies beſides. And thus much for the firſt thing taken for granted, without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof, by your <hi>Sennertus:</hi> And to add that upon the Bye (continues <hi>Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>) we may hence learn what to judge of the way of Argumentation, which that fierce Champion of the <hi>Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> againſt the Chymiſts,

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105458:169"/>it ſelf to conſiſt of four Elements. The Ratiocination it ſelf (purſues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades</hi>) being ſomewhat unuſual, I did the other Day Tranſcribe it, and (ſayes He, pulling a Paper out of his Pocket) it is this. <hi>Ordiamur, cum Beguino, a ligno viridi, quod ſi concremetur, videbis in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Aquam, in fumo Aerem, in flamma &amp; Prunis Ignem, Terram in cineribus: Quod ſi Beguino placuerit ex eo colligere humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum aquoſum, cohibere humidum oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſum, extrahere ex cineribus ſalem; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ipſi in unoquoque horum ſeorſim quatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Elementa ad oculum demonſtrabo, eodem artificio quo in ligno viridi ea demonſtravi.

                  </p>
                  <p>This bold Diſcourſe (reſumes <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> putting up again his Paper,) I think it were not very difficult to confure, if his Arguments were as conſiderable as our time will probably prove ſhort for the remaining and more neceſſary Part of my Diſcourſe; wherefore referring You for an Anſwer to what was ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diſſipated Parts of a burnt piece of green Wood, to what I told <hi>Themiſtius</hi> on the like occaſion, I might eaſily ſhew You, how ſleightly and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially our <hi>Guntherus</hi> talks of the dividing the flame of Green Wood into his four Elements; <hi>When</hi> he makes that vapour to be air, which being caught in Glaſſes and condens'd, preſently diſcovers it ſelf to have been but an Aggregate of innumerable very minute drops of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and <hi>When</hi> he would prove the Phlegmes being compos'd of Fire by that Heat which is adventitious to the Liquor, and ceaſes upon the abſence of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105458:170"/>it (whether that be an Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeding from the motion of the External Fire, or the preſence of a Multitude of igneous Atomes pervading the pores of the Veſſel, and nimbly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meating the whole Body of the Water) I might, I ſay, urge theſe and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weakneſſes of His Diſcourſe. But I will rather take Notice of what is more pertinent to the Occaſion of this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, namely, that Taking it for Granted, that Fluidity (with which he unwarily ſeems to confound Humidity) muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Element of Water, he makes a Chymical Oyle to Conſiſt of that Elementary Liquor; and yet in the very next Words proves, that it conſiſts alſo of Fire, by its Inflamability; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that exquiſitely pure Spirit of Wine is both more Fluid then Water it ſelf, and yet will Flame all away without leaving the Leaſt Aqueous Moiſture behind it; and without ſuch an <hi>Amurca</hi> and Soot as he would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the preſence of Earth from. So that the ſame Liquor may according to his Doctrine be concluded by its great Fluidity to be almoſt all Water; and by its burning all away to be all diſguiſed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105458:170"/>Fire. And by the like way of Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Author would ſhew that the fixt ſalt of Wood is compounded of the four Elements. For (ſayes he) being turn'd by the violence of the Fire into ſteames, it ſhews it ſelf to be of kin to Air; whereas I doubt whether he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw a true fixt Salt (which to become ſo, muſt have already endur'd the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of an Incinerating Fire) brought by the Fire alone to aſcend in the Forme of Exhalations; but I do not doubt that if he did, and had caught thoſe Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in convenient Veſſels, he would have found them as well as the Steames of common Salt, &amp;c. of a Saline and not an Aereal Nature. And whereas our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour takes it alſo for Granted, that the Fuſibility of Salt muſt be Deduc'd from Water, it is indeed ſo much the Effect of heat variouſly agitating the Minute Parts of a Body, without regard to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Gold (which by its being the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyeſt and fixteſt of Bodies, ſhould be the moſt Earthy) will be brought to Fuſion by a ſtrong Fire; which ſure is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to drive away then increaſe its Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ingredient, if it have any; and on the other ſide, for want of a ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105458:171"/>of its minute parts, Ice is not Fluid, but Solid; though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes alſo that the Mordicant Quality of Bodies muſt proceed from a fiery ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; whereas, not to urge that the Light and inflamable parts, which are the moſt likely to belong to the Element of Fire, muſt probably be driven away by that time the violence of the Fire has reduc'd the Body to aſhes; Not to urge this, I I ſay, nor that Oyle of Vitriol which quenches Fire, burnes the Tongue and fleſh of thoſe that Unwarily taſt or apply it, as a cauſtick doth, it is precarious to prove the Preſence of Fire in fixt ſalts from their Cauſtick power, unleſſe it were firſt ſhewn, that all the Qualities aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to ſalts muſt be deduc'd from thoſe of the Elements; which, had I Time, I could eaſily manifeſt to be no eaſy talk. And not to mention that our Authour makes a Body as Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as any he can produce for Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, belong both to Water and Fire, Though it be neither Fluid nor Inſipid, like Water; nor light and Volatile, like Fire; he ſeems to omit in this Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Element of Earth, ſave That he intimates, That the ſalt may paſs for

For ſince There is a manifeſt Difference betwixt the Saline and the inſipid Parts of Aſhes, I ſee not how ſubſtances That Diſagree in ſuch Notable Qualities can be both ſaid to be Portions of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Nature requires that it be Homogeneous, eſpecially in this caſe where an <hi>Analyſis</hi> by the Fire is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have ſeparated it from the admixture of other Elements, which are confeſs'd by moſt <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> to be Generally found in common Earth, and to render it impure. And ſure if when we have conſider'd for how little a Diſparities ſake the Peripateticks make theſe Symbolizing Bodies Aire and Fire to be two Diſtinct Elements, we ſhall alſo conſider that the Saline part of Aſhes is very ſtrongly Taſted, and eaſily ſoluble in Water; whereas the other part of the ſame Aſhes is inſipid and indiſſoluble in the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: Not to add, that the one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is Opacous, and the other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:105458:172"/>Diaphanous, nor that they differ in Divers other Particulars; If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe things, I ſay, we ſhall hardly think that both theſe Subſtances are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Earth; And as to what is ſometimes objected, that their Saline Taſt is only an Effect of Incineration and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtion, it has been elſewhere fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to, when propos'd by <hi>Themistius,</hi> and where it has been prov'd againſt him, that however inſipid Earth may perhaps by Additaments be turn'd into Salt, yet 'tis not like it ſhould be ſo by the Fire alone: For we ſee that when we refine Gold and Silver, the violenteſt Fires We can Employ on them give them not the leaſt Relliſh of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And I think <hi>Philoponus</hi> has right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd, that the Aſhes of ſome Concretes contain very little ſalt if any at all; For Refiners ſuppoſe that bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes are free from it, and therefore make uſe of them for Teſts and Cuppels, which ought to be Deſtitute of Salt, leſt the Violence of the Fire ſhould bring them to Vitrification; And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purpoſely and heedfully taſted a Cuppel made of only bone-aſhes and fair water, which I had caus'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:105458:172"/>to a Very Violent Fire, acuated by the Blaſt of a large pair of Double Bellows, I could not perceive that the force of the Fire bad imparted to it the leaſt Saltneſs, or ſo much as made it leſs Inſipid.</p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) ſince neither You nor I love Repetitions, I ſhall not now make any of what elſe was urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Themiſtius</hi> but rather invite You to take notice with me that when our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, though a Learned Man, and one that pretends skill enough in Chymiſtry to reforme the whole Art, comes to make good his confident Undertaking, to give us an occular Demonſtration of the immediate Preſence of the four Elements in the reſolution of Green Wood, He is fain to ſay things that agree very little with one another. For about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that paſſage of His lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to you, he makes the ſweat as he calls it of the green Wood to be Water, the ſmoke Aire, the ſhining Matter Fire, and the Aſhes Earth; whereas a few lines after, he will in each of theſe, nay (as I juſt now noted) in one Diſtinct Part of the Aſhes, ſhew the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So that either the former <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:105458:173"/>muſt be incompetent to prove that Number of Elements, ſince by it the burnt Concrete is not reduc'd into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bodies, but into ſuch as are yet each of them compounded of the four Elements; or elſe theſe Qualities from which he endeavours to deduce the preſence of all the Elements, in the fixt ſalt, and each of the other ſeparated ſubſtances, will be but a precarious way of probation: eſpecially if you conſider, that the extracted <hi>Alcali</hi> of Wood, being for ought appears at leaſt as ſimilar a Body as any that the Peripateticks can ſhew us, if its differing Qualities muſt argue the preſence of Diſtinct Elements, it will ſcarce be poſſible for them by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way they know of employing the fire upon a Body, to ſhew that any Body is a Portion of a true Element: And this recals to my mind, that I am now but in an occaſional Excuſſion, which aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to ſhew that the Peripateticks as well as the Chymiſts take in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſie ſomething for granted which they ought to prove, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my exceptions, where I ended the firſt of them, and further tell you, that neither is that the only precarious
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105458:173"/>thing that I take notice of in <hi>Sennertus</hi> his Argumentation; for when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, that becauſe the Qualities he Mentions as Colours, Smels, and the like, belong not to the Elements; they therefore muſt to the Chymical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he takes that for granted, which will not in haſte be prov'd; as I might here manifeſt, but that I may be and by have a fitter opportunity to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. And thus much at preſent may ſuffice to have Diſcours'd againſt the Suppoſition, that almoſt every Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt have ſome <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as they ſpeak, ſome Native receptacle, wherein as in its proper Subject of in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it peculiarly reſides, and on whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that quality belongs to the other Bodies, Wherein it is to be met with. Now this Fundamental ſuppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once Deſtroy'd, whatſoever is built upon it, muſt fall to ruine of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But I conſider further, that Chymiſts are (for ought I have found) far from being able to explicate by any of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> thoſe qualities which they pretend to belong primarily unto it, and in mixt Bodies to Deduce from it. Tis true indeed, that ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:105458:174"/>are not explicable by the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; but it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they are ſo by the three herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Principles; and this is it that ſeems to have deceiv'd the Chymiſts, and is indeed a very common miſtake amongſt moſt Diſputants, who argue as if there could be but two Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Difficulty about which they contend; and conſequently they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, that if their Adverſaries Opinion be Erroneous, Their's muſt needs be the Truth; whereas many queſtions, and eſpecially in matters Phyſiological, may admit of ſo many Differing <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> that 'twill be very inconſiderate and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious to conclude (except where the Opinions are preciſely Contradictory) the Truth of one from the falſity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And in our particular caſe 'tis no way neceſſary, that the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mixt Bodies muſt be explicable either by the Hermetical, or the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian Hypotheſis,</hi> there being divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more plauſible wayes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining them, and eſpecially that, which deduces qualities from the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, figure, and contrivance of the ſmall parts of Bodies; as I think might be
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105458:174"/>ſhewn, if the attempt were as ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I fear it would be Tedious.</p>
                  <p>I will allow then, that the Chymiſts do not cauſeleſsly accuſe the Doctrine of the four elements of incompetency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Properties of Compound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And for this Rejection of a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Error, they ought not to be deny'd what praiſe men may deſerve for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploding a Doctrine whoſe Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo conſpicuous, that men need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but not to ſhut their Eyes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. But I am miſtaken, if our Hermetical Philoſophers Themſelves need not, as well as the Peripateticks, have Recourſe to more Fruitfull and Comprehenſive Principles then the <hi>trial Prima,</hi> to make out the Properties of the Bodies they converſe with. Not to accumulate Examples to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (becauſe I hope for a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to proſecute this Subject) let us at preſent only point at Colour, that you may gueſs by what they ſay of ſo obvious and familiar a Quality, how little Inſtruction we are to expect from the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> in thoſe more abſtruſe ones, which they with the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> ſtile Occult. For about Colours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:105458:175"/>do they at all agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor have I met with any one, of which of the three Perſwaſions ſoever, that does intelligibly explicate Them. The Vulgar Chymiſts are wont to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Colours to Mercury;
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in divers places attributes them to Salt; and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> having recited their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Opinions, Diſſents from both, and referrs Colours rather unto Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. But how Colours do, nay, how they may, ariſe from either of theſe Principles, I think you will ſcarce ſay that any has yet intelligibly explicated. And if Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> will allow me to ſhew you the Experiments which he has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected about Colours, you will, I doubt not, confeſs that bodies exhibite colours, not upon the Account of the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of this or that Principle in them, but upon that of their Texture, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Diſpoſition of their ſuperficial parts, whereby the Light rebounding thence to the Eye is ſo modifi'd, as by differing Impreſſions variouſly to affect the Organs of Sight. I might here take notice of the pleaſing variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours exhibited by the Triangular glaſs, (as 'tis wont to be call'd) and demand,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105458:175"/>what addition or decrement of either Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, befalls the Body of the Glaſs by being Priſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally figur'd; and yet 'tis known, that without that ſhape it would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for'd thoſe colours as it does. But becauſe it may be objected, that theſe are not real, but apparent Colours; that I may not loſe time in examing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I will alledge againſt the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, a couple of examples of Real and Permanent Colours Drawn from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Bodies, and repreſent, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of any extraneous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Quickſilver may by the Fire alone, and that in glaſs Veſſels, be depriv'd of its ſilver-like Colour, and be turn'd into a Red Body; and from this Red Body without Addition likewiſe may be obtain'd a Mercury Bright and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as it was before; So that I have here a laſting Colour Generated and Deſtroy'd (as I have ſeen) at pleaſure, without adding or taking away either Mercury, Salt, or Sulphur; and if you take a clean and ſlender piece of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd ſteel, and apply to it the flame of a candle at ſome little diſtance ſhort of the point, You ſhall not have held
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105458:176"/>the Steel long in the flame, but You ſhall perceive divers Colours, as Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Red and Blew, to appear upon the Surface of the metal, and as it were run along in chaſe of one another towards the point; So that the ſame body, and that in one and the ſame part, may not only have a new colour produc'd in it, but exhibite ſucceſſively divers Colours within a minute of an hour, or thereabouts; and any of theſe Colours may by Removing the Steel from the Fire, become Permanent, and laſt many years. And this Production and Variety of Colours cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be ſuppos'd to proceed from the Acceſſion of any of the three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to which of them ſoever Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts will be pleas'd to aſcribe Colours; eſpecially conſidering, that if you but ſuddenly Refrigerate that Iron, Firſt made Red hot, it will be harden'd and Colourleſs again; and not only by the Flame of a Candle, but by any other equivalent heat Conveniently appli'd, the like Colours will again be made to appear and ſucceed one another, as at the Firſt. But I muſt not any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute an Occaſional Diſcourſe, though
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:105458:176"/>that were not ſo Difficult for me to do, as I fear it would be for the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to give a better Account of the other Qualities, by their Principles, then they have done of Colours. And your <hi>Sennertus</hi> Himſelf (though an Author I much value) would I fear have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly puzl'd to reſolve, by the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> halfe that Catalogue of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,

And ſuppoſing it were true, that Salt or Sulphur were the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to which this or that Quality may be peculiarly referr'd, yet though he that teaches us this teaches us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning That quality, yet he Teaches us but ſomething. For indeed he does not Teach us That which can in any Tollerable meaſure ſatisfie an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Searcher after Truth. For what is it to me to know, that ſuch a quality reſides in ſuch a Principle or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, whilſt I remain altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Cauſe of that quality, and the manner of its production and Operation? How little do I know more then any Ordinary Man of Gravity, if I know but that the Heavineſs of mixt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105458:177"/>bodies proceeds from that of the Earth they are compos'd of, if I know not the reaſon why the Earth is Heavy? And how little does the Chymiſt teach the Philoſopher of the Nature of Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he only tells him that the Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue of Medicines reſides in their Salt? For, beſides that this muſt not be conceded without Limitation, ſince the purging parts of many Vegetables Extracted by the Water wherein they are infus'd, are at moſt but ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Salts, (I mean mingl'd with Oyle, and Spirit, and Earth, as Tartar and divers other Subjects of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdom afford;) And ſince too that Quickſilver precipitated either with Gold, or without Addition, into a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is wont to be ſtrongly enough Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartical, though the Chymiſts have not yet prov'd, that either Gold or Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have any Salt at all, much leſs any that is Purgative; Beſides this, I ſay, how little is it to me, to know That 'tis the Salt of the Rhubarb (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) that purges, if I find That it does not purge as Salt; ſince ſcarce any Elementary Salt is in ſmall quantity ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartical. And if I know not how
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105458:177"/>Purgation in general is effected in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body? In a word, as 'tis one thing to know a mans Lodging, and another, to be acquainted with him; ſo it may be one thing to know the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein a Quality principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and another thing to have a right notion and knowledg of the quality its ſelf. Now that which I take to be the reaſon of this Chymical Deficiency, is the ſame upon whoſe account I think the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi> and divers other Theories incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to explicate the Origen of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For I am apt to think, that men will never be able to explain the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Nature, while they endeavour to deduce them only from the Preſence and Proportion of ſuch or ſuch material In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and conſider ſuch ingredients or Elements as Bodies in a ſtate of reſt; whereas indeed the greateſt part of the affections of matter, and conſequently of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of nature, ſeems to depend upon the motion and the continuance of the ſmall parts of Bodies. For 'tis by motion that one part of matter acts upon another; and 'tis, for the moſt part, the texture of the Body upon which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parts ſtrike, that modifies to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105458:178"/>or Impreſſion, and concurrs with it to the production of thoſe Effects which make up the chief part of the Naturaliſts Theme.</p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) me thinks for all this, you have left ſome part of what I alledg'd in behalf of the three principles, unanſwer'd. For all that you have ſaid will not keep this from being a uſeful Diſcovery, that ſince in the Salt of one Concrete, in the Sulphur of another and the Mercury of a third, the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertue of it reſides, that Principle ought to be ſeparated from the reſt, and there the deſired faculty muſt be ſought for.</p>
                  <p>I never denyed (Replyes <hi>Carneades</hi>) that the Notion of the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> may be of ſome uſe, but (continues he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) by what you now alledg for it, it will but appear That it is uſeful to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, rather than to Philoſophers, The being able to make things Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being ſufficient to thoſe, whereas the Knowledge of Cauſes is the Thing looked after by Theſe. And let me Tell You, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> even this it ſelf will need to be entertained with ſome caution.</p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:105458:178"/>
                  <p>For firſt, it will not preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That if the Purgative or other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a ſimple may be eaſily extracted by Water or Spirit of Wine, it Reſides in the Salt or Sulphur of the Concrete; Since unleſſe the Body have before been reſolved by the Fire, or ſome Other Powerful Agent, it will, for the moſt part, afford in the Liquors I have nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather the finer compounded parts of it ſelf, Than the Elementary ones. As I noted before, That Water will diſſolve not only pure Salts, but Cryſtals of Tartar, Gumme Arabick, Myrr'h, and Other Compound Bodies. As alſo Spirit of Wine will Diſſolve not only the pure Sulphur of Concretes, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the whole Subſtance of divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous Bodies, as Benzoin, the Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous parts of Jallap, Gumme Lacca, and Other bodies that are counted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Mixt. And we ſee that the Extracts made either with Water or Spirit of Wine are not of a ſimple and Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Nature, but Maſſes conſiſting of the looſer Corpuſeles, and finer parts of the Concretes whence they are Drawn; ſince by Diſtillation they may be Divided into more Elementary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:105458:179"/>
                  <p>Next, we may conſider That even when there intervenes a Chymical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution by he Fire, 'tis ſeldom in the Saline or Sulphureous principle, as ſuch, that the deſir'd Faculty of the Concrete Reſides; But, as that Titular Salt or Sulphur is yet a mixt body, though the Saline or Sulphureous Nature be predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in it. For, if in Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions the ſeparated Subſtances were pure and ſimple Bodies, and of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Elementary Nature; no one would be indued with more Specifick Vertues, than another; and their qualities would Differ as Little as do thoſe of Water. And let me add this upon the bye, That even Eminent Chymiſts have ſuffer'd themſelves to be reprehended by me for their over great Diligence in purifying ſome of the things they obtain by Fire from mixt Bodies. For though ſuch compleatly purifyed Ingredients of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might perhaps be more ſatisfactory to our Underſtanding; yet others are often more uſeful to our Lives, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of ſuch Chymical Productions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending moſt upon what they retain of the Bodies whence they are ſeparated, or gain by the new aſſociations of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105458:179"/>among themſelves; whereas if they were meerly Elementary, their uſes would be comparatively very ſmall; and the vertues of Sulphurs, Salts, or Other ſuch Subſtances of one denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would be the very ſame.</p>
                  <p>And by the Way <hi>(Eleutherius)</hi> I am inclin'd upon this ground to Think, That the artificial reſolution of compound bodies by Fire does not ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich mankind, as it divides them into their ſuppoſed Principles; as upon the ſcore of its making new compounds by new combinations of the diſſipated parts of the reſolv'd Body. For by this means the Number of mixt Bodies is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed. And many of thoſe new productions are indow'd with uſeful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, divers of which they owe not to the body from which they were obtein'd, but to Their newly Acquired Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, that which is principally to be Noted is this, that as there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Concretes whoſe Faculties reſide in ſome one or other of thoſe differing Subſtances that Chymiſts call their Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, Salts, and Mercuries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may be beſt obtain'd, by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyzing
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:105458:180"/>the Concrete whereby the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principles may be had ſever'd or freed from the reſt; So there are other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the nobleſt properties lodge not in the Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, but depend immediately upon the form (or if you will) reſult from the determinate ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Whole Concrete; and conſequently they that go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Vertues of ſuch bodies, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to the Violence of the Fire, do exceedingly miſtake, and take the way to Deſtroy what they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>I remmember that <hi>Helmont</hi> himſelf ſomewhere confeſſes, That as the Fire betters ſome things and improves their Vertues, ſo it ſpoyles others and makes them degenerate. And elſewhere he judiciouſly affirmes, that there may be ſometimes greater vertue in a ſimple, ſuch as Nature has made it, than in any thing that can by the fire be ſeparated from it.

To which I ſhall now add no other example than that afforded us by Amber; which, whilſt it remains an intire body, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with an Electrical faculty of drawing to it ſelf fethers, ſtrawes, and ſuch like Bodies; which I never could obſerve either in its Salt, its Spirit, its Oyle, or in the Body I remember I once made by the reunion of its divided Elements; none of theſe having ſuch a Texture as the intire Goncrete. And however Chymiſts boldly deduce ſuch and ſuch properties from this or that proportion of their component Principles; yet in Concretes that abound with this or that Ingredient, 'tis not alwayes ſo much by vertue of its preſence, nor its plenty, that the Concrete is qualify'd to perform ſuch and ſuch Effects; as upon the account
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105458:181"/>of the particular texture of that and the other Ingredients, aſſociated after a determinate Manner into one Concrete (though poſſibly ſuch a proportion of that ingredient may be more convenient than an other for the conſtituting of ſuch a body.) Thus in a clock the hand is mov'd upon the dyal, the bell is ſtruck, and the other actions belonging to the engine are perform'd, not becauſe the Wheeles are of braſs or iron, or part of one metal and part of another, or becauſe the weights are of Lead, but by Vertue of the ſize, ſhape, bigneſs, and co-aptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeveral parts; which would performe the ſame things though the wheels were of Silver, or Lead, or Wood, and the Weights of Stone or Clay; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Fabrick or Contrivance of the engine were the ſame: though it be not to be deny'd, that Braſſe and Steel are more convenient materials to make clock-wheels of than Lead, or Wood. And to let you ſee, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> that 'tis ſometimes at leaſt, upon the Texture of the ſmall parts of a body, and not alwaies upon the preſence, or receſſe, or increaſe, or Decrement of any one of its Principle, that it may loſe ſome
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105458:182"/>ſuch Qualities, and acquire ſome ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as are thought very ſtrongly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the bodies they Reſide in. I will add to what may from my paſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe be refer'd to this purpoſe, this Notable Example, from my Own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; That Lead may without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament, and only by various applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fire, loſe its colour, and acquire ſometimes a gray, ſometimes a yellowiſh, ſometimes a red, ſometimes an <hi>amethihſtine</hi> colour; and after having paſt through theſe, and perhaps divers others, again recover its leaden colour, and be made a bright body. That alſo this Lead, which is ſo flexible a metal, may be made as brittle as Glaſſe, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought to be again flexible and Malleable as before. And beſides, that the ſame lead, which I find by <hi>Microſcopes</hi> to be one of the moſt opacous bodies in the World, may be reduced to a fine tranſparent glaſſe; whence yet it may returne to an opacous Nature again; and all this, as I ſaid, without the addition of any extraneous body, and meerly by the manner and Method of expoſing it to the Fire.</p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) after having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105458:182"/>put you to ſo prolix a trouble, it is time for me to relieve you with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of putting ſpeedily a period to it; And to make good that promiſe, I ſhall from all that I have hitherto diſcourſed with you, deduce but this one propoſition by way of Corollary. <hi>[That it may as yet be doubted, whether or no there be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Number of Elements; Or, if you pleaſe, whether or no all compound bodies, do conſiſt of the ſame number of Elementary ingredients or material Principles.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being but an inference from the foregoing Diſcourſe, it will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to inſiſt at large on the proofs of it; But only to point at the chief of Them, and Referr You for Particulars to what has been already Delivered.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt place then, from what has been ſo largely diſcours'd, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Experiments wont to be brought, whether by the common Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks, or by the vulgar Chymiſts, to demonſtrate that all mixt bodies are made up preciſely either of the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, or the three Hypoſtatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, do not evince what they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to prove. And as for the other common arguments, pretended to be
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105458:183"/>drawn from Reaſon in favour of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotelian Hypotheſis</hi> (for the Chymiſts are wont to rely almoſt altogether upon Experiments) they are Commonly grounded upon ſuch unreaſonable or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Suppoſitions, that 'tis altogether as eaſie and as juſt for any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, as for thoſe that take them for granted to aſſert them, being indeed all of them as indemonſtrable as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be inferr'd from them; and ſome of them ſo manifeſtly weak and proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; that he muſt be a very courteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, that can be willing togrant them; and as unskilful a one, that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, it may be conſidered, if what thoſe Patriarchs of the <hi>Spagyriſts, Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> do on divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions poſitively deliver, be true; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Alkahest</hi> does Reſolve all mixt Bodies into other Principles than the fire, it muſt be decided which of the two reſolutions (that made by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahest,</hi> or that made by the fire) ſhall determine the number of the Elements, before we can be certain how many there are.</p>
                  <p>And in the mean time, we may take
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105458:183"/>notice in the laſt place, that as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſubſtances whereinto the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> divides bodies, are affirm'd to be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nature from thoſe whereunto they are wont to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by fire,

So, although we ſhould acquieſce in that reſolution which is made by fire, we find not that all mixt bodies are thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the ſame number of Elements and Principles; ſome Concretes afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more of them than others do; Nay and ſometimes this or that Body afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater number of Differing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by one way of management, than the ſame yields by another.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105458:184"/>more congruous to that variety that ſo much conduceth to the perfection of the Univerſe, that all elemented bodies be compounded of the ſame numberof E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, then it would be for a language, that all its words ſhould conſiſt of the ſame number of Letters.</p>

                  <p>HEre <hi>Carneades</hi> Having Diſpach't what he Thought Requiſite to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt what the Chymiſts are wont to alledge for Proof of their three Principles, Paus'd awhile, and look'd about him, to diſcover whether it were Time for him and his Friend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the Reſt of the Company. But <hi>Eleutherius</hi> perceiving nothing yet to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:105458:185"/>forbid Them to Proſecute their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a little further, ſaid to his Friend, (who had likewiſe taken Notice of the ſame thing) I halfe expected, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades,</hi> that after you had ſo freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Your doubting, whether there be any Determinate Number of Elements, You would have proceeded to queſtion whether there be any Elements at all. And I confeſs it will be a Trouble to me if You defeat me of my Expectation; eſpecially ſince you ſee the leaſure we have allow'd us may probably ſuffice to examine that Paradox; becauſe you have ſo largly Deduc'd already many Things pertinent to it, that you need but intimate how you would have them Apply'd, and what you would inferr from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carneades</hi> having in Vain repreſented that their leaſure could be but very ſhort, that he had already prated very long, that he was unprepared to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo great and ſo invidious a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, was at length prevail'd with to tell his Friend; Since, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> you will have me Diſcourſe <hi>Ex Tempore</hi> of the Paradox you mention, I am content, (though more perhaps to expreſs my
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:105458:185"/>Obedience, then my Opinion) to tell you that (ſuppoſing the Truth of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s Alkaheſtical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, if I may ſo call them) though it may ſeem extravagant, yet it is not abſurd to doubt, whether, for ought has been prov'd, there be a neceſſity to admit any Elements, or Hypoſtatical Principles, at all.</p>
                  <p>And, as formerly, ſo now, to avoid the needleſs trouble of Diſputing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> and the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, I will addreſs my ſelf to oppoſe them I have laſt nam'd, Becauſe their Doctrine about the Elements is more applauded by the Moderns, as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly to be grounded upon Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. And, to deal not only fairly but favourably with them, I will allow them to take in Earth and Water to their other Principles. Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, the rather that my Diſcourſe may the better reach the Tenents of the Peripateticks; who cannot plead for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo probably as for thoſe two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that of fire above the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generally by Judicious Men explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as an Imaginary thing; And the Air not concurring to compoſe Mixt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105458:186"/>Bodies as one of their Elements, but only lodging in their pores, or Rather repleniſhing, by reaſon of its Weight and Fluidity, all thoſe Cavities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here below, whether compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not, that are big enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, and are not fill'd up with any groſſer ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>And, to prevent miſtakes, I muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize You, that I now mean by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as thoſe Chymiſts that ſpeak plaineſt do by their Principles, certain Primitive and Simple, or perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled bodies; which not being made of any other bodies, or of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the Ingredients of which all thoſe call'd perfectly mixt Bodies are immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately reſolved: now whether there be any one ſuch body to be conſtantly met with in all, and each, of thoſe that are ſaid to be Elemented bodies, is the thing I now queſtion.</p>
                  <p>By this State of the controverſie you will, I ſuppoſe, Gueſs, that I need not be ſo abſur'd as to deny that there are ſuch bodies as Earth, and Water, and Quickſilver, and Sulphur: But I look upon Earth and Water, as component parts
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105458:186"/>of the Univerſe, or rather of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe, not of all mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And though I will not peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily deny that there may ſometimes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a running Mercury, or a Combuſtible Subſtance be obtain'd from a Mineral, or even a Metal; yet I need not Concede either of them to be an Element in the ſence above declar'd; as I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew you by and by.</p>
                  <p>To give you then a brief account of the grounds I intend to proceed upon, I muſt tell you, that in matters of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, this ſeems to me a ſufficient reaſon to doubt of a known and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant propoſition, that the Truth of it is not yet by any competent proof made to appear. And congruouſly herunto, if I ſhew that the grounds upon which men are perſwaded that there are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements are unable to ſatisfie a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering man, I ſuppoſe my doubts will appear rational.</p>
                  <p>Now the Conſiderations that induce men to think that there are Elements, may be conveniently enough referr'd to two heads. Namely, the one, that it is neceſſary that Nature make uſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements to conſtitute the bodies that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105458:187"/>are reputed Mixt. And the other, That the Reſolution of ſuch bodies manifeſts that nature had compounded them of Elementary ones.</p>
                  <p>In reference to the former of theſe Conſiderations, there are two or three things that I have to Repreſent.</p>
                  <p>And I will begin with reminding you of the Experiments I not long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to you concerning the growth of pompions, mint, and other vegetables, out of fair water. For by thoſe experiments its ſeems evident, that Water may be Tranſmuted into all the other Elements; from whence it may be inferr'd, both, That 'tis not every Thing Chymiſts will call Salt, Sulphur, or Spirit, that needs alwayes be a Primordiate and Ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body. And that Nature may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex a Plant (though that be a perfectly mixt Concrete) without having all the Elements previouſly preſented to her to compound it of. And, if you will allow the relation I mention'd out of <hi>Mounſieur De Rochas</hi> to be True; then may not only plants, but Animals and Minerals too, be produced out of Water, And however there is little doubt to be made, but that the plants my tryals afforded me
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105458:187"/>as they were like in ſo many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the reſt of the plants of the ſame Denomination; ſo they would, in caſe I had reduc'd them to putrefaction, have likewiſe produc'd Wormes or other infects, as well as the reſembling Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables are wont to do; ſo that Water may, by Various Seminal Principles, be ſucceſſively Tranſmuted into both plants and Animals. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that not only Men, but even ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children are, but too often, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Solid Stones, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Beaſts themſelves, (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Helmont</hi> againſt Experience think to the contrary) may be Troubled with great and Heavy ſtones in their Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladders, though they Feed but upon Graſs and other Vegetables, that are perhaps but Diſguiſed Water, it will not ſeem improbable that even ſome Concretes of a mineral Nature, may Likewiſe be form'd of Water.</p>
                  <p>We may further Take notice, that as a Plant may be nouriſht, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may Conſiſt of Common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo may both plants and Animals, (perhaps even from their Seminal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments) conſiſt of compound Bodies,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105458:188"/>without having any thing meerly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary brought them by nature to be compounded by them: This is evident in divers men, who whilſt they were Infants were fed only with Milk, afterwards Live altogether upon Fleſh, Fiſh, wine, and other perfectly mixt Bodies. It may be ſeen alſo in ſheep, who on ſome of our Engliſh Downs or Plains, grow very fat by feeding upon the graſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcarce drinking at all. And yet more manifeſtly in the magots that breed and grow up to their full bigneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pulps of Apples, Pears, or the like Fruit. We ſee alſo, that Dungs that abound with a mixt Salt give a much more ſpeedy increment to corn and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vegetables than Water alone would do: And it hath been aſſur'd me, by a man experienc'd in ſuch matters, that ſometimes when to bring up roots very early, the Mould they were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in was made over-rich, the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Plant has raſted of the Dung. And let us alſo conſider a Graft of one kind of Fruit upon the upper bough of a Tree of another kind. As for inſtance, the Ciens of a Pear upon a White-thorne; for there the aſcending
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105458:188"/>Liquor is already alter'd, either by the root, or in its aſcent by the bark, or both wayes, and becomes a new mixt body: as may appear by the differing qualities to be met with in the ſaps of ſeveral trees; as particularly, the medicinal vertue of the Birch-Water (which I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drunk upon <hi>Helmonts</hi> great and not undeſerved commendation) Now the graft, being faſten'd to the ſtock muſt neceſſarily nouriſh its ſelf, and produce its Fruit, only out of this compound Juice prepared for it by the Stock, being unable to come at any other aliment. And if we conſider, how much of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he feeds upon may (as we noted above) remain in an Animal; we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſuppoſe, That the blood of that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal who Feeds upon this, though it be a Well conſtituted Liquor, and have all the differing Corpuſcles that make it up kept in order by one praeſiding form, may be a ſtrangely Decompounded Body, many of its parts being themſelves decompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So little is it Neceſſary that even in the mixtures which nature her ſelf makes in Animal and Vegetable Bodies, ſhe ſhould have pure Elements at hand to make her compoſitions of.</p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:105458:189"/>
                  <p>Having ſaid thus much touching the conſtitution of Plants and Animals, I might perhaps be able to ſay as much touching that of Minerals, and even Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, if it were as eaſy for us to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in Order to the production of theſe, as of thoſe. But the growth or increment of Minerals being uſually a work of exceſſively long time, and for the moſt part perform'd in the bowels of the Earth, where we cannot ſee it, I muſt inſtead of Experiments make uſe, on this occaſion, of Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>That ſtones were not all made at once, but that are ſome of them now adayes generated, may (though it be deny'd by ſome) be fully prov'd by ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of which I ſhall now ſcarce alledg any other, then that famous place in <hi>France</hi> known by the name of <hi>Les Caves Gentieres,</hi> where the Water falling from the upper Parts of the cave to the ground does preſently there condenſe into little ſtones, of ſuch figures as the drops, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either ſeverally or upon one another, and coagulating preſently into ſtone, chance to exhibit. Of theſe ſtones ſome Ingenuous Friends of ours, that went a while ſince to viſit that place, did me
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105458:189"/>the favour to preſent me with ſome that they brought thence. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that both that ſober Relator of his Voyages, <hi>Van Linſchoten,</hi> and another good Author, inform us that in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Mines (as they call them) in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> when having dig'd the Earth, though to no great depth, they find Diamonds and take them quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; Yet in a very few years they find in the ſame place new Diamonds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd there ſince. From both which Relations, eſpecially the firſt, it ſeems probable that Nature does not alwayes ſtay for divers Elementary Bodies, when ſhe is to produce ſtones. And as for Metals themſelves, Authors of good note aſſure us, that even they were not in the beginning produc'd at once altogether, but have been obſerv'd to grow; ſo that what was not a Mineral or Metal before became one afterwards. Of this it were eaſie to alledg many teſtimonies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chymiſts. But that they may have the greater authority, I ſhall rather preſent you with a few borrowed from more unſuſpected writers. <hi>Sulphuris Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neram</hi> (as the inquiſitive <hi>P.

                  <p>The other two Relations I have not met with in Latine Authours, and yet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:105458:191"/>they are both very memorable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as pertinent to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt I meet with in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of <hi>Johannes Valehius</hi> upon the <hi>Kleine Baur,</hi> In which that Induſtrious Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt Relates, with many circumſtances, that at a Mine-Town (If I may ſo Engliſh the German <hi>Bergſtat</hi>) eight miles or Leagues diſtant from <hi>Straſburg</hi> call'd <hi>Mariakirch,</hi> a Workman came to the Overſeer, and deſired employment; but he telling him that there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the beſt ſort at preſent for him, added that till he could be preferr'd to ſome ſuch, he might in the mean time, to avoid idleneſs, work in a Grove or Mine-pit thereabouts, which at that time was little eſteem'd. This Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man after ſome weeks Labour, had by a Crack appearing in the Stone upon a Stroak given near the wall, an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Given him to Work his Way through, which as ſoon as he had done, his Eyes were ſaluted by a mighty ſtone or Lump which ſtood in the middle of the Cleft (that had a hollow place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it) upright, and in ſhew like an armed-man; but conſiſted of pure fine
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:105458:192"/>Silver having no Vein or Ore by it, or any other Additament, but ſtood there free, having only underfoot ſomething like a burnt matter; and yet this one Lump held in Weight above a 1000 marks, which, according to the Dutch, Account makes 500 pound weight of fine ſilver. From which and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances my Author gathers; That by the warmth of the place, the Noble Metalline Spirits, (Sulphureous and Mercurial) were carri'd from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Galleries or Vaults, through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmaller Cracks and Clefts, into that Cavity, and there collected as in a cloſe Chamber or Cellar; whereinto when they were gotten, they did in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time ſettle into the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned precious maſs of Metal.</p>
                  <p>The other Germane Relation is of That great Traveller and Laborious Chymiſt <hi>Johannes</hi> (not <hi>Georgus) Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> who in his notes upon what <hi>Poppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> has written of Antimony, Relates, that when he was among the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines in the deep Groves, he obſerv'd that there would often ariſe in them a warm Steam (not of that malignant ſort which the Germains call <hi>Shwadt,</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:105458:192"/>which (ſayes he) is a meer poyſon, and often ſuffocates the Diggers, which faſten'd it ſelf to the Walls; and that coming again to review it after a couple of dayes, he diſcern'd that it was all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt, and gliſtering; whereupon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving collected it and Diſtill'd it <hi>per Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortam,</hi> he obtain'd from it a fine Spirit, adding, that the Mine-Men inform'd him, that this Steam or Damp of the Engliſh Mine (retaining the dutch Term) would at laſt have become a Metal, as Gold or Silver.</p>
                  <p>I referr (ſayes <hi>Carneades</hi>) to another Occaſion, the Uſe that may be made of theſe Narratives towards the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Nature of Metalls; and that of Fixtneſs, Malleableneſs, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Qualities conſpicuous in them. And in the mean time, this I may at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deduce from theſe Obſervations, That 'tis not very probable, that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Mineral, or even a Metall, is to be Generated in the Bowels of the Earth, Nature needs to have at hand both Salt, and Sulphur, and Mercury to Compound it of; for, not to urge that the two laſt Relations ſeem leſs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Chymiſts than <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:105458:193"/>would have Metals Generated of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Halitus</hi> or ſteams, the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Obſervations together, make it ſeem more Likely that the mineral Earths or thoſe Metalline ſteams (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with probably ſuch Earths are plentifully imbu'd) do contain in them ſome ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rudiment, or ſome thing Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thereunto; by whoſe plaſtick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the reſt of the matter, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Terreſtrial and heavy, is in Tract of time faſhion'd into this or That me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Ore; almoſt as I formerly noted, that fair water was by the ſeminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Mint, Pompions, and other Vegetables, contriv'd into Bodies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſuch Seeds. And that ſuch Alterations of Terreſtrial matter are not impoſſible, ſeems evident from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Practice of the Boylers of Salt-Petre, who unanimouſly obſerve, as well here in <hi>England</hi> as in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; That if an Earth pregnant with Nitre be depriv'd, by the affuſion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of all its true and diſſoluble Salt, yet the Earth will after ſome years yield them Salt-Petre again; For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſome of the eminent and skillfulleſt of them keep it in heaps as a perpetual
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:105458:193"/>Mine of Salt Petre; whence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Seminal Principle of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre latent in the Earth does by degrees Transforme the neighbouring matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Nitrous Body; for though I deny that ſome Volatile Nitre may by ſuch Earths be attracted (as they ſpeak) out of the Air, yet that the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of ſuch great heaps that lye ſo remote from the Air ſhould borrow from it all the Nitre they abound with, is not probable, for other reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the remoteneſs of the Air, though I have not the Leaſure to mention them.</p>
                  <p>And I remember, that a perſonof Great Credit, and well acquainted with the wayes of making Vitriol, affirm'd to me, that he had obſerv'd, that a kind of mineral which abounds in that Salt, being kept within Doors and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd (as is uſual) to the free Air and Rains, did of it ſelf in no very long time turn into Vitriol, not only in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or ſuperficial, but even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and moſt Central parts.</p>
                  <p>And I alſo remember, that I met with a certain kind of Merkaſite that lay together in great Quantities under
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:105458:194"/>ground, which did, even in my chamber, in ſo few hours begin of it ſelf to turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vitriol, that we need not diſtruſt the newly recited narrative. But to return to what I was ſaying of Nitre; as Nature made this Salt-Petre out of the once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and inodorous Earth it was bred in, and did not find a very ſtinking and corroſive Acid Liquor, and a ſharp Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyzate Salt to compound it of, though theſe be the Bodies into which the Fire diſſolves it; ſo it were not neceſſary that Nature ſhould make up all Metals and other Minerals of Pre-exiſtent Salt, and Sulphur, and Mereury, though ſuch Bodies might by Fire be obtained from it. Which one conſideration duly weigh'd is very conſiderable in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: And to this agree well the Relations of our two German Chymiſts; for beſides that it cannot be convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd, it is not ſo much as likely that ſo languid and moderate a heat as that within the Mines, ſhould carry up to ſo great a heat, though in the forme of fumes, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; ſince we find in our Diſtillations, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a conſiderable Degree of Fire to raiſe ſo much as to the height of one
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:105458:194"/>foot not only Salt, but even Mercury it ſelf, in cloſe Veſſels. And if it be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it ſeems by the ſtink that is ſometimes obſerv'd when Lightening falls down here below, that ſulphureous ſteams may aſcend very high without any extraordinary Degree of heat; It may be anſwer'd, among other things, that the Sulphur of Silver is by Chymiſts ſaid to be a fixt Sulphur, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo well Digeſted as that of Gold.</p>
                  <p>But, proceeds <hi>Carneades,</hi> If it had not been to afford You ſome hints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Origine of Metals, I need not have deduc'd any thing from theſe Obſervations; It not being neceſſary to the Validity of my Argument that my Deductions from them ſhould be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable, becauſe my Adverſaries the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> and Vulgar Chymiſts do not, I preſume, know any better then I, <hi>a priori,</hi> of what ingredients Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Metals and Minerals. For their Argument to prove that thoſe Bodies are made up of ſuch Principles, is drawn <hi>a poſteriori;</hi> I mean from this, that upon the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Mineral bodies they are reſolv'd into thoſe differing ſubſtances.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:105458:195"/>That we may therefore examine this Argument, Let us proceed to conſider what can be alledg'd in behalf of the <hi>E.</hi> lements from the Reſolutions of Bodies by the fire; which you remember was the ſecond Tophick whence I told you the Arguments of my Adverſaries were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd.</p>
                  <p>And that I may firſt diſpatch what I have to ſay concerning Minerals, I will begin the remaining part of my diſcourſe with conſidering how the fire divides them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I have partly noted above, that though Chymiſts pretend from ſome to draw ſalt, from others running Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and from others a Sulphur; Yet they have not hitherto taught us by any way in us among them to ſeparate any one principle, whether Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, from all ſorts of Minerals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. And thence I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to conclude that there is not any of the Elements that is an Ingredient of all Bodies, ſince there are ſome of which it is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, ſuppoſing that either Sulphur or Mercury were obtainable from all ſorts of Minerals. Yet ſtill this
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:105458:195"/>Sulphur or Mercury would be but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, not an Elementary body, as I told you already on another occaſion. And certainly he that takes notice of the wonderful Operations of Quickſilver, whether it be common, or drawn from Mineral Bodies, can ſcarce be ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as to think it of the very ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that immature and fugitive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which in Vegetables and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals Chymiſts have been pleas'd to call their Mercury. So that when Mercury is got by the help of the fire out of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or other Mineral Body, if we will not ſuppoſe that it was not pre-exiſtent in it, but produc'd by the action of the fire upon the Concrete, we may at leaſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Quickſilver to have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Body of its own kind (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps leſſe heterogeneous then more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary mixts) which happen'd to be mingl'd <hi>per minima,</hi> and coagulated with the other ſubſtances, whereof the Metal or Mineral conſiſted. As may be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied partly by Native Vermillion wherein the Quickſilver and Sulphur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exquiſitely blended both with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that other courſe Mineral ſtuff (what ever it be) that harbours
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:105458:196"/>them, make up a red body differing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from both; and yet from which part of the Quickſilver, and of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, may be eaſily enough obtain'd; Partly by thoſe Mines wherein nature has ſo curiouſly incorporated Silver with Lead, that 'tis extreamly difficult, and yet poſſible, to ſeparate the former out of the Latter. And partly too by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vitriol, wherein the Metalline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles are by skill and induſtry ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the ſaline ones, though they be ſo con-coagulated with them, that the whole Concrete is reckon'd among Salts.</p>
                  <p>And here I further obſerve, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could ſee any Earth or Water, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo call'd, ſeparated from either Gold or Silver (to name now no other Metalline Bodies) and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the argument upon my Adverſaries, I may conclude, that ſince there are ſome bodies in which, for ought appears, there is neither Earth nor Water. I may be allow'd to conclude that neither of thoſe two is an Univerſal Ingredient of all thoſe Bodies that are counted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixt, which I deſire you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member againſt Anon.</p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:105458:196"/>
                  <p>It may indeed be objected, that the reaſon why from Gold or Silver we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeparate any moiſture, is, becauſe that when it is melted out of the Oare, the vehement Fire requiſite to its Fuſion forc'd away all the aqueous and fugitive moiſture; and the like fire may do from the materials of Glaſs. To which I ſhall Anſwer, that I Remember I read not long ſince in the Learned <hi>Joſephus Acoſta,</hi> who relates it upon his own obſervation; that in <hi>America,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aceſta</hi> Natural. and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory of the Indies, L. 3. c. 5, P. 212.</note> (where he long lived) there is a kind of Silver which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Papas,</hi> and ſometimes (ſayes he) they find pieces very fine and pure like to ſmall round roots, the which is rare in that metal, but uſuall in Gold; Concerning which metal he tells us, that beſides this they find ſome which they call Gold in grains, which he tells us are ſmall morſels of Gold that they find whole without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any other metal, which hath no need of melting or Refining in the fire.</p>
                  <p>I remember that a very skilful and credible perſon affirmed to me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> mines he had the good fortune to ſee a mineral that was
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:105458:197"/>there digg'd up, wherein pieces of Gold of the length, and alſo almoſt of the bigneſs of a humane Finger, grew in the Oar, as if they had been parts and Branches of Trees.</p>
                  <p>And I have my ſelf ſeen a Lump of whitiſh Mineral, that was brought as a Rarity to a Great and knowing Prince, wherein there grew here and there in the Stone, which looked like a kind of ſparr, divers little Lumps of fine Gold, (for ſuch I was aſſured that Tryal had manifeſted it to be) ſome of them Seeming to be about the Bigneſs of peaſe.</p>
                  <p>But that is nothing to what our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſta</hi> ſubjoynes, which is indeed very memorable, namely, that of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Native and pure Gold, which we lately heard him mentioning he had now and then ſeen ſome that weighed many pounds; to which I ſhall add, that I my ſelf have ſeen a Lump of Oar not long ſince digged up,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Acoſla</hi> in the fore-cited Place, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Pliny</hi> quoted by him.</note> in whoſe ſtony part there grew, almoſt like Trees, divers parcels though not of Gold, yet of (what perhaps Mineraliſts will more wonder at) another Metal which ſeemed to be very pure or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105458:197"/>with any Heterogeneous Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and were ſome of them as big as my Finger, if not bigger. But upon Obſervations of this kind, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I could, yet I muſt not at preſent dwell any longer.</p>
                  <p>To proceed Therefore now (ſayes <hi>Carneades)</hi> to the Conſideration of the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Vegetables, although my Tryals give me no cauſe to doubt but that out of moſt of them five differing Subſtances may be obtain'd by the fire, yet I think it will not be ſo eaſily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that theſe deſerve to be call'd Elements in the Notion above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
                  <p>And before I deſcend to particulars, I ſhall repeat and premiſe this General Conſideration, that theſe differing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that are call'd Elements or Principles, differ not from each other as Metals, Plants and Animals, or as ſuch Creatures as are immediately produc'd each by its peculiar Seed, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a diſtinct propagable ſort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Univerſe; but theſe are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Various Schemes of matter or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that differ from each other, but in conſiſtence (as Running Mercury and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105458:198"/>the ſame Metal congeal'd by the Vapor of Lead) and ſome very few other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as Taſt, or Smel, or Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or the want of them. So that by a change of Texture not impoſſible to be wrought by the Fire and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents that have the Faculty not only to diſſociate the ſmal parts of Bodies, but afterwards to connect them after a new manner, the ſame parcell of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may acquire or loſe ſuch accidents as may ſuffice to Denominate it Salt, or Sulphur, or Earth. If I were fully to clear to you my apprehenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, I ſhould perhaps be obliged to acquaint you with divers of the Conjectures (for I muſt yet call them no more) I have had Concerning the Principles of things purely Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real: For though becauſe I ſeem not ſatisfi'd with the Vulgar Doctrines, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Peripatetick or Paracelſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Schools, many of thoſe that know me, (and perhaps, among Them, <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> himſelf) have thought me wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Epicurean <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> (as others have miſtaken me for an <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montian;)</hi> yet if you knew how little Converſant I have been with <hi>Epicurean</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:105458:198"/>Authors, and how great a part of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> himſelf I never yet had the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioſity to read, you would perchance be of another mind; eſpecially if I were to entertain you at large, I ſay not, of my preſent Notions; but of my former thoughts concerning the Principles of things. But, as I ſaid above, fully to clear my Apprehenſions would require a Longer Diſcourſe than we can now have.</p>
                  <p>For, I ſhould tell you that I have ſometimes thought it not unfit, that to the Principles which may be aſſign'd to things, as the World is now Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, we ſhould, if we conſider the Great Maſs of matter as it was whilſt the Univerſe was in making, add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which may Conveniently enough be call'd an Architectonick Principle or power; by which I mean thoſe Various Determinations, and that Skilfull Guidance of the motions of the ſmall parts of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal matter by the moſt wiſe Author of things, which were neceſſary at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to turn that confus'd <hi>Chaos</hi> into this Orderly and beautifull World; and Eſpecially, to contrive the Bodies of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:105458:199"/>and Plants, and the Seeds of thoſe things whoſe kinds were to be propagated. For I confeſs I cannot well Conceive, how from matter, Barely put into Motion, and then left to it ſelf, there could Emerge ſuch Curious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks as the Bodies of men and perfect Animals, and ſuch yet more admirably Contriv'd parcels of matter, as the ſeeds of living Creatures.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould likewiſe tell you upon what grounds, and in what ſence, I ſuſpected the Principles of the World, as it now is, to be Three, <hi>Matter, Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest.</hi> I ſay, <hi>as the World now is,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the preſent Fabrick of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and eſpecially the ſeeds of things, together with the eſtabliſht Courſe of Nature, is a Requiſite or Condition, upon whoſe account divers things may be made out by our three Principles, which otherwiſe would be very hard, if poſſible, to explicate.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould moreover declare in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (for I pretend not to be able to do it otherwiſe) not only why I Conceive that Colours, Odors, Taſts, Fluidneſs and Solidity, and thoſe other qualities that Diverſifie and Denominate Bodies
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:105458:199"/>may Intelligibly be Deduced from theſe three; <hi>but how two of the Three</hi> Epicurean Principles (which, I need not tell, you are Magnitude, Figure and Weight) are Themſelves Deducible from Matter and Motion; ſince the Latter of theſe Variouſly Agitating, and, as it were, Diſtracting the Former, muſt needs disjoyne its parts; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Actually ſeparated muſt Each of them neceſſarily both be of ſome Size, and obtain ſome ſhape or other. Nor did I add to our Principles the <hi>Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean Privation,</hi> partly for other Reaſons, which I muſt not now ſtay to inſiſt on; and partly becauſe it ſeems to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Antecedent, or a <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> then a True Principle, as the ſtarting-Poſt is none of the Horſes Legs or Limbs.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould alſo explain why and how I made reſt to be, though not ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Principle of things, as Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet a Principle of them; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is (for ought we know as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at leaſt as it, and depends not upon Motion, nor any other quality of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and partly, becauſe it may enable the Body in which it happens to be,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:105458:200"/>both to continue in a State of Reſt till ſome external force put it out of that ſtate, and to concur to the production of divers Changes in the bodies that hit againſt it, by either quite ſtopping or leſsning their Motion (whilſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy formerly at Reſt Receives all or part of it into it ſelf) or elſe by giving a new Byaſs, or ſome other Modification, to Motion, that is, To the Grand and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary inſtrument whereby Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces all the Changes and other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that are to be met with in the World.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould likewiſe, after all this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you how, although Matter, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſt, ſeem'd to me to be the Catholick Principles of the Univerſe, I thought the Principles of Particular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might be Commodiouſly enough reduc'd to two, namely <hi>Matter,</hi> and (what Comprehends the two other, and their effects) the reſult or Aggregate of thoſe Accidents, which are the Motion or Reſt, (for in ſome Bodies both are not to be found) the Bigneſs, Figure, Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and the thence reſulting Qualities of the ſmall parts) which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to intitle the Body whereto they

Which Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate or reſult of Accidents you may, if You pleaſe, call either <hi>Structure</hi> or Texture.</p>
                  <p>Though indeed, that do not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comprehend the motion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts eſpecially in caſe ſome of them be Fluid, or what other appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall appear moſt Expreſſive. Or if, retaining the Vulgar Terme, You will call it the <hi>Forme</hi> of the thing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates, I ſhall not much oppoſe it; Provided the word be interpreted to mean but what I have expreſs'd, and not a Scholaſtick <hi>Subſtantial Forme,</hi> which ſo many intelligent men profeſs to be to them altogether Un-intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>But, ſayes <hi>Carneades,</hi> if you remember that 'tis a Sceptick ſpeaks to you, and that 'tis not ſo much my preſent Talk
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105458:201"/>to make aſſertions as to ſuggeſt doubts, I hope you will look upon what I have propos'd, rather as a Narrative of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conjectures touching the principles of things, then as a Reſolute Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my preſent opinions of them; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince although they cannot but appear Very much to their Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, If you Conſider Them as they are propos'd without thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Explanations by which I could perhaps make them appear much leſſe extravagant; yet I want time to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you what may be alledg'd to clear and countenance theſe notions; my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in mentioning them unto you at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being, <hi>partly,</hi> to bring ſome Light and Confirmation to divers paſſages of my diſcourſe to you; <hi>partly</hi> to ſhew you, that I do not (as you ſeem to have ſuſpected) embrace all <hi>Epicurus</hi> his principles; but Diſſent from him in ſome main things, as well as from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Chymiſts, in others; &amp; <hi>partly</hi> alſo, or rather chiefly, to intimate to you the grounds upon which I likewiſe differ from <hi>Helmont</hi> in this, that whereas he aſcribes almoſt all things, and even diſeaſes themſelves, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Seeds; I am of opinion, that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:105458:201"/>beſides the peculiar Fabricks of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Plants and Animals (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo of ſome Metals and Minerals) which I take to be the Effects of ſeminal principles, there are many other bodies in nature which have and deſerve diſtinct and Proper names, but yet do but reſult from ſuch contextures of the matter they are made of, as may without determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeeds be effected by heat, cold, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial mixtures and compoſitions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other cauſes which ſometimes nature imployes of her own accord; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times man by his power and skill makes uſe of to faſhion the matter according to his Intentions. This may be exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the productions of Nature, and in thoſe of Art; of the firſt ſort I might name multitudes; but to ſhew how ſleight a variation of Textures without addition of new ingredients may procure a parcel of matter divers names, and make it be Lookt upon as Different Things;</p>
                  <p>I ſhall invite you to obſerve with me, That Clouds, Rain, Hail, Snow, Froth, and Ice, may be but water, having its parts varyed as to their ſize and diſtance in reſpect of each other, and as to motion
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:105458:202"/>and reſt. And among Artificial Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we may take notice (to skip the Cryſtals of Tartar) of Glaſs, Regulus, Martis-Stellatus, and particularly of the Sugar of Lead, which though made of that inſipid Metal and ſour ſalt of Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, has in it a ſweetneſſe ſurpaſſing that of common Sugar, and divers other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which being not to be found in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its two ingredients, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to belong to the Concrete it ſelf, upon the account of its Texture.</p>
                  <p>This Conſideration premis'd, it will be, I hope, the more eaſie to perſwade you that the Fire may as well produce ſome new textures in a parcel of matter, as deſtroy the old.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore hoping that you have not forgot the Arguments formerly imploy'd againſt the Doctrine of the <hi>Tria prima;</hi> namely that the Salt, Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, into which the Fire ſeems to reſolve Vegetable and Animal Bodies, are yet compounded, not ſimple and Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subſtances; And that (as appeared by the Experiment of Pompions) the <hi>Tria prima</hi> may be made out of Water; hoping I ſay, that you remember Theſe and the other Things that I formerly repreſented
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:105458:202"/>to the ſame purpoſe, I ſhall now add on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if we doubt not the Truth of ſome of <hi>Helmonts</hi> Relation, We may well doubt whether any of theſe Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neities be (I ſay not pre-exiſtent, ſo as to convene together, when a plant or Animal is to be conſtituted but) ſo much as in-exiſtent in the Concrete whence they are obtain'd, when the Chymiſts firſt goes about to reſolve it; For, not to inſiſt upon the un-inflamable Spirit of ſuch Concretes, becauſe that may be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be but a mixture of Phlegme and Salt; the Oyle or Sulphur of Vegetables or Animals is, according to him, reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the help of Lixiviate Salts into Sope; as that Sope is by the help of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Diſtillations from a <hi>Caput Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of Chalk into inſipid Water. And as for the ſaline ſubſtance that ſeems ſeparable from mixt bodies;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Omne autem Alcali additae pinguedine in aqueum liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, qui tandem mera &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex aqua fit, reducitur, (ut videre eſt in Sapone, Lazurio lapide, &amp;c.) quoties per adjuncta fixa ſemen Pingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis deponit.</hi> Helmont.</note> the ſame <hi>Helmonts</hi> tryals give us cauſe to think, That it may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Fire, which by tranſporting and otherwiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the particles of the matter, does bring it to a Saline nature.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:105458:203"/>
                  <p>For I know (ſayes he, in the place formerly alledg'd to another purpoſe) a way to reduce all ſtones into a meer Salt of equal weight with the ſtone whence it was produc'd, and that without any of the leaſt either Sulphur or Mercury; which aſſeveration of my Author would perhaps ſeem leſs incredible to You, if I durſt acquaint You with all I could ſay upon that ſubject. And hence by the way you may alſo conclude that the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Mercury, as they call them, that Chymiſts are wont to obtain from compound Bodies by the Fire, may poſſibly in many Caſes be the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it; ſince if the ſame bodies had been wrought upon by the Agents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by <hi>Helmont,</hi> they would have yielded neither Sulphur nor Mercury; and thoſe portions of them which the Fire would have preſented Us in the forme of Sulphureous and Mercurial Bodies would have, by <hi>Helmonts</hi> method, been exhibited to us in the form of Salt.</p>
                  <p>But though (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) You have alledg'd very plauſible Arguments againſt the <hi>tria Prima,</hi> yet I ſee not how it will be poſſible for you to avoid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that Earth and Water are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:105458:203"/>Elementary Ingredients, though not of Mineral Concretes, yet of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Vegetable Bodies; Since if any of theſe of what ſort ſoever be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Diſtillation, there is regularly and conſtantly ſeparated from it a phlegme or aqueous part and a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or Earth.</p>
                  <p>I readily acknowledged (anſwers <hi>Carneades</hi>) it is not ſo eaſy to reject Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Earth (and eſpecially the former) as 'tis to reject the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Elements of mixt Bodies; but 'tis not every difficult thing that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then, as to Water, that the chief Qualities which make men give that name to any viſible Subſtance, are, that it is Fluid or Liquid, and that it is inſipid and inodorous. Now as for the taſt of theſe qualities, I think you have never ſeen any of thoſe ſeparated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that the Chymiſts call Phlegme which was perfectly devoyd both of Taſt and Smell: and if you object, that yet it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that ſince the whole Body is Liquid, the maſs is nothing but Elementary Water faintly imbu'd with ſome of the Saline or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:105458:204"/>parts of the ſame Concrete, which it retain'd with it upon its Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Other Ingredients. To this I anſwer, That this Objection would not appear ſo ſtong as it is plauſible, if Chymiſts underſtood the Nature of Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Compactneſſe; and that, as I formerly obſerv'd, to a Bodies being Fluid there is nothing neceſſary, but that it be divided into parts ſmall enough; and that theſe parts be put into ſuch a motion among themſelves as to glide ſome this way and ſome that way, along each others Surfaces. So that, although a Concrete were never ſo dry, and had not any Water or other Liquor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent in it, yet ſuch a Comminution of its parts may be made, by the fire or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Agents, as to turn a great portion of them into Liquor. Of this Truth I will give an inſtance, employ'd by our friend here preſent as one of the moſt conducive of his experiments to Illuſtrate the nature of Salts. If you Take, then, ſea ſalt and melt it in the Fire to free it from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous parts, and afterward diſtill it with a vehement Fire from burnt Clay, or any other, as dry a <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> as you pleaſe, you will, as Chymiſts confeſs,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:105458:204"/>by teaching it drive over a good part of the Salt in the form of a Liquor. And to ſatisfy ſome ingenious men, That a great part of this Liquor was ſtill true ſea ſalt brought by the Operation of the Fire into Corpuſcles ſo ſmall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo advantageouſly ſhap'd, as to be capable of the forme of a Fluid Body, He did in my preſence poure to ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual ſalts a due proportion of the ſpirit (or ſalt and Phlegme) of Urine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by having evaporated the ſuperfluous moiſture, he ſoon obtain'd ſuch another Concrete, both as to taſt and ſmell, and eaſie ſublimableneſs as common Salt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> which you know is made up of groſſe and undiſtill'd ſea ſalt united with the ſalts of Urine and of Soot, which two are very neer of kin to each other. And further, to manifeſt that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of ſea ſalt and the Saline ones of Urine retain their ſeveral Natures in this Concrete, He mixt it with a convenient quantity of Salt of Tartar, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to Diſtillation ſoon regain'd his ſpirit of Urine in a liquid form by its ſelf, the Sea ſalt ſtaying behind with the Salt of Tartar. Wherefore it is very poſſible that dry Bodies may by the Fire be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:105458:205"/>to Liquors without any ſeparation of Elements, but barely by a certain kind of Diſſipation and Comminution of the matter, whereby its parts are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new ſtate. And if it be ſtill objected, that the Phlegme of mixt Bodies muſt be reputed water, becauſe ſo weak a taſt needs but a very ſmall proportion of Salt to impart it; It may be reply'd, that for ought appears, common Salt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other bodies, though they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd never ſo dry, and in never ſo cloſe Veſſels, will yield each of them pretty ſtore of a Liquor, wherein though (as I lately noted) Saline Corpuſcles abound, Yet there is beſides a large proportion of Phlegme, as may eaſily be diſcovered by coagulating the Saline Corpuſeles with any convenient Body; as I lately told you, our Friend coagulated part of the Spirit of Salt with Spirit of Urine: and as I have divers times ſeparated a ſalt from Oyle of Vitriol it ſelf (though a very ponderous Liquor and drawn from a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line body) by boyling it with a juſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Mercury, and then waſhing the newly coagulated ſalt from the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with fair Water. Now to what can we more probably aſcribe this plenty
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:105458:205"/>of aqueous Subſtance afforded us by the Diſtillation of ſuch bodies, than unto this, That among the various operations of the Fire upon the matter of a Concrete, divers particles of that matter are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſuch a ſhape and bigneſſe as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to compoſe ſuch a Liquor as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are wont to call Phlegme or Water. How I conjecture this change may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, 'tis neither neceſſary for me to tell you, nor poſſible to do ſo without a much longer diſcourſe then were now ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But I deſire you would with me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon what I formerly told you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terning the change of Quickſilver into Water; For that Water having but a very faint taſt, if any whit more than divers of thoſe liquors that Chymiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to Phlegme; By that experiment it ſeems evident, that even a metalline bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore much more ſuch as are but Vegetable or Animal, may by a ſimple operation of the Fire be turn'd in great part into Water. And ſince thoſe I diſpute with are not yet able out of Gold, or Silver, or divers other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes to ſeparate any thing like Water; I hope I may be allow'd to conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Them, that water it ſelf is not an
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:105458:206"/>Univerſal and pre-exiſtent Ingredient of Mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>But as for thoſe Chymiſts that, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing with me the Truth of what <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> relates of the <hi>Alkahest</hi>'s wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects, have a right to preſs me with his Authority concerning them, and to alledge that he could Tranſmute all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putedly mixt Bodies into inſipid and meer Water; To thoſe I ſhall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, That though his Affirmations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſtrongly againſt the Vulgar Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts (againſt whom I have not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcrupl'd to Employ Them) ſince they Evince that the Commonly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Principles or Ingredients of Things are not Permanent and indeſtructible, ſince they may be further reduc'd into Inſipid Phlegme differing from them all; Yet till we can be allow'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this Liquor, I think it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to doubt whether it be not ſomething elſe then meer Water. For I find not any other reaſon given by <hi>Helmont</hi> of his Pronouncing it ſo, then that it is inſipid. Now Sapour being an Accident or an Affection of matter that relates to our Tongue, Palate, and other Organs of Taſt, it may very poſſibly be,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:105458:206"/>that the ſmall Parts of a Body may be of ſuch a Size and Shape, as either by their extream Littleneſs, or by their ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, or by their Figure, to be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pierce into and make a percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impreſſion upon the Nerves or Membranous parts of the Organs of Taſt, and what may be fit to work o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe upon divers other Bodies than meer Water can, and conſequently to Diſcloſe it ſelf to be of a Nature farr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from Elementary. In Silke dyed Red or of any other Colour, whilſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Contiguous Threads makes up a skein, the Colour of the Silke is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; but if only a very few of them be lookt upon, the Colour will appear much fainter then before. But if You take out one ſimple Thread, you ſhall not eaſily be able to diſcern any Colour at all; So ſubtile an Object having not the Force to make upon the Optick Nerve an Impreſſion great enough to be taken Notice of. It is alſo obſerv'd, that the beſt ſort of Oyl-Olive is almoſt taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and yet I need not tell you how exceedingly diſtant in Nature Oyle is from VVater. The Liquor into which I told you, upon the Relation of <hi>Lully,</hi>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:105458:207"/>and Eye-witneſs that Mercury might be Tranſmuted, has ſometimes but a very Languid, if any Taſt, and yet its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations even upon ſome Mineral Bodies are very peculiar. Quickſilver it ſelf alſo, though the Corpuſcles it conſiſts of be ſo very ſmall as to get into the Pores of that Cloſeſt and compacteſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Gold, is yet (you know) altogether Taſtleſs. And our <hi>Helmont</hi> ſeveral times tells us, that fair Water wherein a little Quantity f Quickſilver has lain for ſome time, though it acquire no certain Taſt or other ſenſible Quality from the Quickſilver; Yet it has a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy wormes in humane Bodies; which he does much, but not cauſeleſsly extoll. And I remember, a great Lady, that had been Eminent for her Beauty in Divers Courts, confeſs'd to me, that this inſipid Liquor was of all innocent waſhes for the Face the beſt that ſhe ever met with.</p>
                  <p>And here let me conclude my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning ſuch waters or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors as I have hitherto been exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with theſe two Conſiderations. VVhereof the firſt is, That by reaſon of our being wont to drink nothing but
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:105458:207"/>VVine, Bear, Cyder, or other ſtrongly taſted Liquors, there may be in ſeveral of theſe Liquors, that are wont to paſs for inſipid Phlegme, very peculiar and Diſtinct, Taſts though unheeded (and perhaps not to be perceiv'd) by Us. For to omit what Naturaliſts affirm of Apes, (and which probably may be true of divers other Animals) that they have a more exquiſite palate than Men: among Men themſelves, thoſe that are wont to drink nothing but water may (as I have try'd in my ſelf) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern very ſenſibly a great Difference of Taſts in ſeveral waters, which one un-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to drink water would take to be all alike inſipid. And this is the <hi>first</hi> of my two Conſiderations; the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is, That it is not impoſſible that the Corpuſcles into which a body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated by the Fire may by the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame fire have their figures ſo altered, or may be by aſſociations with one another brought into little Maſſes of ſuch a Size and Shape, as not to be fit to make ſenſible Impreſſions on the Tongue. And that you may not think ſuch alterations impoſſible, be pleaſed to conſider with me; that not
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:105458:208"/>only the ſharpeſt Spirit of Vinager ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſſolved as much Corall as it can, will Coagulate with it into a Subſtance, which though ſoluble in water, like ſalt, is incomparably leſs ſtrongly Taſted then the Vinager was before; but (what is more conſiderable) though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid ſalts that are carried up with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver in the preparation of common ſublimate are ſo ſharp, that being moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened with water it will Corrode ſome of the Metals themſelves; yet this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Sublimate being twice or thrice re-ſublim'd with a full proportion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid Quickſilver, Conſtitutes (as you know) that Factitious Concrete, which the Chymiſts call <hi>Mercurius dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> not becauſe it is ſweet, but becauſe the ſharpneſs of the Corroſive Salts is ſo taken away by their Combination with the Mercurial Corpuſcles, that the whole mixture when it is prepar'd is judg'd to be inſipid.</p>
                  <p>And thus (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given you ſome Reaſons why I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to admit Elementary water for a conſtant Ingredient of Mixt Bodies, It will be eaſie for me to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why I alſo reject Earth.</p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:105458:208"/>
                  <p>For firſt, it may well be ſuſpected that many Subſtances paſs among Chymiſts under the name of Earth, becauſe, like it, they are Dry, and Heavy, and Fixt, which yet are very farr from an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Nature. This you will not think improbable, If you recall to mind what I formerly told you concerning what Chymiſts call the Dead Earth of things, and eſpecially touching the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be drawn from the <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> of Vitriol; And if alſo you allow me to ſubjoyn a caſual but memorable Experiment made by <hi>Johannes Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> upon the <hi>Terra Damnata</hi> of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Our Author then tells us (in his notes upon <hi>Popius,</hi>) that in the year 1621 he made an Oyle of Sulphur; the remaining <hi>Faeces</hi> he reverberated in a moderate Fire fourteen dayes; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he put them well luted up in a VVind Oven, and gave them a ſtrong Fire for ſix hours, purpoſing to calcine the <hi>Faeces</hi> to a perfect Whiteneſs, that he might make ſometing elſe out of them. But coming to break the pot, he found above but very little <hi>Faeces,</hi> and thoſe Grey and not White; but beneath there lay a fine Red <hi>Regulus</hi>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:105458:209"/>which he firſt marvell'd at and knew not what to make of, being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that not the leaſt thing, beſides the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Sulphur, came into the pot; and that the Sulphur it ſelf had only been diſſolv'd in Linſeed Oyle; this <hi>Regulus</hi> he found heavy and malleable almoſt as Lead; having caus'd a Goldſmith to draw him a Wire of it, he found it to be of the Faireſt copper, and ſo right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colour'd, that a Jew of <hi>Prague</hi> Offer'd him a great price for it. And of this Metal he ſayes he had 12 <hi>loth</hi> (or ſix ounces) out of one pound of Aſhes or <hi>Faeces.</hi> And this Story may well incline us to ſuſpect that ſince the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Mortuum</hi> of the Sulphur was kept ſo long in the fire before it was found to be any thing elſe then a <hi>Terra dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> there may be divers other Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Bodies which are wont to paſs only for the Terreſtrial <hi>Faeces</hi> of things, and therefore to be thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as ſoon as the Diſtillation or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of the Body that yielded them is ended; which yet if they were long and Skilfully examin'd by the fire would appear to be differing from Elementary Earth. And I have taken notice of the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:105458:209"/>unwarrantable forwardneſs of common Chymiſts to pronounce things uſeleſs <hi>Faeces,</hi> by obſerving how often they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Verdegreaſe; which is yet ſo farr from deſerving that Name, that not only by ſtrong fires and convenient Additaments it may in ſome hours be reduc'd into copper, but with a certain Flux Powder I ſometimes make for Recreation, I have in two or three minutes obtain'd that Metal from it. To which I may add, that having for tryall ſake kept Venetian Taclk in no leſs a heat than that of a glaſs Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, I found after all the Brunt of the fire it had indur'd, the remaining Body though brittle and diſcolour'd, had not loſt very much of its former Bulke, and ſeem'd ſtill to be nearer of kin to Talck than to meer Earth. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber too, that a candid Mineraliſt, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his Skill in trying of Oars, requeſting me one day to procure him a certain <hi>American</hi> Mineral Earth of a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> who he thought would not refuſe me; I enquir'd of him why he ſeem'd ſo greedy of it: he confeſs'd to me that this Gentleman having brought that Earth to the publick Say-Maſters;
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:105458:210"/>and they upon their being unable by any means to bring it to fuſion or make it fly away, he (the Relator) had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd a little of it; and having try'd it with a peculiar Flux ſeparated from it neer a third part of pure Gold; ſo great miſtakes may be committed in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily concluding things to be Uſeleſſe Earth.</p>
                  <p>Next, it may be ſuppos'd, That as in the Reſolution of Bodies by the Fire ſome of the diſſipated Parts may, by their various occurſion occaſion'd by the heat, be brought to ſtick together ſo cloſely as to conſtitute Corpuſcles too heavy for the Fire to carry away; the aggregate of which Corpuſcles is wont to be call'd Aſhes or Earth; So other Agents may reſolve the Concrete into Minute Parts, after ſo differing a manner as not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or dry and heavy Body. As you may remember <hi>Helmont</hi> above inform'd us, that with his great Diſſolvent he divided a Coal into two liquid and volatile Bodies, aequiponderant to the Coal, without any dry or fixt Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, I ſee not why it ſhould be neceſſary that all Agents that reſolve
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105458:210"/>Bodies into portions of differingly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd matter muſt work on them the ſame way, and divide them into juſt ſuch parts, both for nature and Number, as the Fire diſſipates them into. For ſince, as I noted before, the Bulk and ſhape of the ſmall Parts of bodies, together with their Fitneſs and Unfitneſs to be eaſily put into Motion, may make the liquors or other ſubſtances ſuch Corpuſcles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as much to differ from each other as do ſome of the Chymical principles: Why may not ſomething happen in this caſe, not unlike what is uſuall in the groſſer diviſions of bodies by Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruments? Where we ſee that ſome Tools reduce Wood, for Inſtance, into darts of ſeveral ſhapes, bigneſſe, and other qualities, as Hatchets and Wedges divide it into groſſer parts; ſome more long and ſlender, as ſplinters; and ſome more thick and irregular, as chips; but all of conſiderable bulk; but Files and Saws makes a Comminution of it into Duſt; which, as all the others, is of the more ſolid ſort of parts; whereas others divide it into long and broad, but thin and flexible parts, as do <hi>Planes:</hi> And of this kind of parts it ſelf there is alſo a
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:105458:211"/>variety according to the Difference of the Tools employ'd to work on the Wood; the ſhavings made by the <hi>plane</hi> being in ſome things differing from thoſe ſhives or thin and flexible pieces of wood that are obtain'd by <hi>Borers,</hi> and theſe from ſome others obtainable by other Tools. Some Chymical Examples applicable to this purpoſe I have elſewhere given you. To which I may add, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a mixture of Sulphur and Salt of Tartar well melted and incorporated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the action of pure ſpirit of wine digeſted on it is to ſeparate the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous from the Alcalizate Parts, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the former and leaving the latter, the action of Wine (probably upon the ſcore of its copious Phlegme) upon the ſame mixture is to divide it into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles conſiſting of both Alcalizate and Sulphureous Parts united. And if it be objected, that this is but a Factitious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete; I anſwer, that however the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may ſerve to illuſtrate what I propos'd, if not to prove it; and that Nature her ſelf doth in the bowels of the Earth make Decompounded Bodies, as we ſee in Vitriol, Cinnaber, and even in Sulphur it ſelf; I will not urge that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:105458:211"/>the Fire divides new Milk into five dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Subſtances; but Runnet and Acid Liquors divide it into a Coagulated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a thin Whey: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide churning divides it into Butter and Butter-milk, which may either of them be yet reduc'd to other ſubſtances differing from the former. I will not preſſe this, I ſay, nor other inſtances of this Nature, becauſe I cannot in few words anſwer what may be objected, that theſe Concretes ſequeſtred without the help of the Fire may by it be further divided into Hypoſtatical Principles. But I will rather repreſent, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſame ſpirit of Wine will diſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the Parts of Camphire, and make them one Liquor with it ſelf; <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will alſo disjoyn them, and put them into motion; but ſo as to keep them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet alter their Texture into the form of an Oyle. I know alſo an uncompounded Liquor, that an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Chymiſt would not allow to be ſo much as Saline, which doth (as I have try'd) from Coral it ſelf (as fixt as divers judicious writers aſſert that Concrete to be) not only obtain a noble Tincture, without the Intervention of Nitre or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:105458:212"/>Salts; but will carry over the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in Diſtillation. And if ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did not forbid me, I could now tell you of a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> I make my ſelf, that doth more odly diſſociate the parts of Minerals very fixt in the fire. So that it ſeems not incredible, that there may be ſome Agent or way of Operation found, whereby this or that Concrete, if not all Firme Bodies, may be reſolv'd into parts ſo very minute and ſo unapt to ſtick cloſe to one another, that none of them may be fixt enough to ſtay behind in a ſtrong Fire, and to be incapable of Diſtillation; nor conſequently to be look'd upon as Earth. But to return to <hi>Helmont,</hi> the ſame Authour ſomewhere ſupply's me with another Argument againſt the Earth's being ſuch an Element as my Adverſaries would have it. For he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where affirms, that he can reduce all the Terreſtrial parts of mixt bodies into infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid water; whence we may argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earths being one of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even from that Notion of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you may remember <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponus</hi> recited out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelf, when he lately diſputed for his Chymiſts againſt <hi>Themiſtius.</hi> And here we may
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:105458:212"/>on this occaſion conſider, that ſince a Body from which the Fire hath driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way its looſer parts is wont to be look'd upon as Earth, upon the Account of its being endow'd with both theſe qualities, Taſtleſſeneſſe and Fixtneſſe, (for Salt of Tartar though Fixt paſſes not among the Chymiſts for Earth, becauſe 'tis ſtrongly Taſted) if it be in the power of Natural Agents to deprive the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of a body of either of thoſe two Qualities, or to give them both to a portion of matter that had them not both before, the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts will not eaſily define what part of a reſolv'd Concrete is earth, and make out, that that Earth is a primary, ſimple, and indeſtructible Body. Now there are ſome caſes wherein the more skilful of the Vulgar Chymiſts themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be able, by repeated Cohobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other fit Operations, to make the Diſtilled parts of a Concrete bring its own <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> over the Helme, in the forme of a Liquor; in which ſtate being both Fluid and Volatile, you will eaſily believe it would not be taken for Earth. And indeed by a skilful, but not Vulgar, way of managing ſome Concretes, there may be more effected
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:105458:213"/>in this kind, then you perhaps would eaſily think. And on the other ſide, that either Earth may be Generated, or at leaſt Bodies that did not before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be neer Totally Earth, may be ſo alter'd as to paſs for it, ſeems very poſſible, if <hi>Helmont</hi> have done that by Art which he mentions in ſeveral places;
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> This Diligent VVriter then in his inſtructive book of fiſhes, affirmes That his Wife kept a fiſh in a Glaſs of water without any other Food for three years; in which ſpace it was conſtantly augmented, till at laſt it could not come out of the Place at which it was put in, and at length was too big for the glaſs it ſelf though that were of a large capacity. And becauſe there is no juſt reaſon to doubt, that this Fiſh, if Diſtill'd, would have yielded the like differing ſubſtances with other Animals: And However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mint which I had out of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afforded me upon Diſtillation a good quantity of Charcoal, I think I may from thence inferr, that Earth it ſelf may be produc'd out of Water; or if you pleaſe, that water may be tranſmuted into Earth; and conſequently, that though it could be prov'd that Earth is an Ingredient actually in-exiſtent in the Vegetable and Animal Bodies whence it may be obtain'd by Fire: yet it would
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:105458:214"/>not neceſſarily follow, that Earth as a pre-exiſtent Element Does with other Principles convene to make up thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies whence it ſeems to have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
                  <p>After all is ſaid (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) I have yet ſomething to Object, that I cannot but think conſiderable, ſince <hi>Carneades</hi> Himſelf alledg'd it as ſuch; for, (continues <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſmiling) I muſt make bold to try whether you can as luckily anſwer your own Arguments, as thoſe of your Antagoniſts, I mean (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues he) that part of your Conceſſions, wherein you cannot but remember that you ſupply'd your Adverſaries with an Example to prove that there may be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Bodies, by taking Notice that Gold may be an Ingredient in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of differing Mixtures, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Nature, notwithſtanding all that the Chymiſts by their Fires and Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Waters are able to do to Deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>I ſufficiently intimated to you at that time (replies <hi>Carneades</hi>) that I propos'd this Example, chiefly to ſhew you how Nature may be Conceived to have made Elements, not to prove that ſhe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:105458:214"/>actually has made any; And you know, that <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe</hi> the Inference will not hold. But (continues <hi>Carneades</hi>) to anſwer more directly to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drawn from Gold, I muſt tell You, that though I know very well that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the more ſober Chymiſts have complain'd of the Vulgar Chymiſts, as of Mountebanks or Cheats, for pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vainly, as hitherto they have done, to Deſtroy Gold; Yet I know a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Menstruum</hi> (which our Friend has made, and intends ſhortly to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to the Ingenious) of ſo piercing and powerfull a Quality, That if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding much care, and ſome skill, I did not much deceive my ſelf, I have with it really deſtroy'd even refin'd Gold, and brought it into a Metalline Body of another colour and Nature, as I found by Tryals purpoſely made. And if ſome juſt Conſiderations did not for the preſent Forbid it, I could Perchance here ſhew you by another Experiment or Two of my own Trying, that ſuch <hi>Menſtruums</hi> may be made as to entice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and retain divers parts, from Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which even the more Judicious and Experienc'd <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:105458:215"/>irreſoluble by the Fire. Though (which I Deſire you would mark) in neither of theſe Inſtances, the Gold or Precious Stones be Analys'd into any of the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> but only Reduc'd to new Concretes. And indeed there is a great Diſparity betwixt the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſeveral Agents whereby the Parts of a Body come to be Diſſipated. As if (for Inſtance) you diſſolve the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort of Vitriol in common Water, the Liquor will ſwallow up the Mineral, and ſo Diſſociate its Corpuſcles, that they will ſeem to make up but one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor with thoſe of the water; and yet each of theſe Corpuſcles retains its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Texture, and remains a Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate and Compounded Body. But if the ſame Vitriol be expoſed to a ſtrong Fire, it will then be divided not only, as before, into ſmaller parts, but into Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous Subſtances, each of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate Corpuſcles that remain'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in the water, being it ſelf upon the Deſtruction of its former Texture diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated or divided into new Particles of differing Qualities. But Inſtances more fitly applicable to this purpoſe, I have already given you. Wherefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:105458:215"/>to what I told you about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gold, that Experiment Invites me to Repreſent to you, that Though there were either Saline, or Sulphureous, or Terreſtrial Portions of Matter, whoſe parts were ſo ſmall, ſo firmly united together, or of a figure ſo fit to make them cohere to one another, (as we ſee that in quickſilver broken into little Globes, the Parts brought to touch one another do immediately re-imbody) that neither the Fire, nor the uſual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents employ'd by Chymiſts, are pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to divide their Parts, ſo as to deſtroy the Texture of the ſingle Corpuſcles; yet it would not neceſſarily follow, That ſuch Permanent Bodies were Elementary, ſince tis poſſible there may be Agents found in Nature, ſome of whoſe parts may be of ſuch a Size and Figure as to take better Hold of ſome parts of theſe ſeemingly Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Corpuſcles than theſe parts do of the reſt, and Conſequently may carry away ſuch parts with them, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Texture of the Corpuſcle by pulling its parts aſunder. And if it be ſaid, that at leaſt we may this way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Elementary Ingredients of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:105458:216"/>Things, by obſerving into what Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces theſe Corpuſcles that were reputed pure are divided; I anſwer, that it is not neceſſary that ſuch a Diſcovery ſhould be practicable. For if the Particles of the Diſſolvent do take ſuch firme hold of thoſe of the Diſſolved Body, they muſt conſtitute together new Bodies, as well as Deſtroy the Old; and the ſtrickt Union, which according to this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> may well be ſuppos'd betwixt the Parts of the Emergent Body, will make it as Little to be Expected that they ſhould be pull'd aſunder, but by little Parts of matter, that to Divide them Aſſociate Themſelves and ſtick extreamly cloſe to thoſe of them which they ſever from their Former Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Beſides that it is not impoſſible, that a Corpuſcle ſuppos'd to be Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary may have its Nature changed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering a Divorce of its parts, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a new Texture Effected by ſome powerfull Agent; as I formerly told you, the ſame portion of matter may eaſily by the Operation of the Fire be turn'd at pleaſure into the form of a Brittle and Tranſparent, or an Opacous and Malleable Body.</p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:105458:216"/>
                  <p>And indeed, if you conſider how farr the bare Change of Texture, whether made by Art or Nature (or rather by Nature with or without the aſſiſtance of man) can go in producing ſuch New Qualities in the ſame parcel of matter, and how many inanimate Bodies (ſuch as are all the Chymical productions of the Fire) we know are Denominated and Diſtinguiſh'd not ſo much by any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Subſtantial Form, as by the aggregate of theſe Qualities. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Things, I ſay, and that the varying of either the figure, or the Size, or the Motion, or the Situation, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Corpuſcles whereof any of theſe Bodies is compos'd, may alter the Fabrick of it, you will poſſibly be invited to ſuſpect, with me, that there is no great need that Nature ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have Elements before hand, whereof to make ſuch Bodies as we call mixts. And that it is not ſo eaſie as Chymiſts and others have hitherto Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, to diſcern, among the many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subſtances that may without any extraordinary skill be obtain'd from the ſame portion of matter, Which ought to be eſteemed excluſively to all the reſt,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:105458:217"/>its in-exiſtent Elementary Ingredients; much leſſe to determine what Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal and Simple Bodies convened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to compoſe it. To exemplify this, I ſhall add to what I have already on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions Repreſented, but this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance.</p>
                  <p>You may remember <hi>(Eleutherius)</hi> that I formerly intimated to you, that beſides Mint and Pompions, I produced divers other Vegetables of very differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures out of Water. Wherefore you will not, I preſume, think it incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſuppoſe, that when a ſlender Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip is ſet into the ground, and takes root, there it may likewiſe receive its Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the water attracted out of the earth by his roots, or impell'd by the warm'th of the ſun, or preſſure of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient air into the pores of them. And this you will the more eaſily believe, if you ever obſerv'd what a ſtrange quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water will Drop out of a wound given to the Vine, in a convenient place, at a ſeaſonable time in the Spring; and how little of Taſt or Smell this <hi>Aqua Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as Phyſitians call it, is endow'd with, notwithſtanding what concoction or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration it may receive in its paſſage
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:105458:217"/>through the Vine, to diſcriminate it from common Water. Suppoſing then this Liquor, at its firſt entrance into the roots of the Vine, to be common Water; Let Us a little conſider how many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subſtances may be obtain'd from it; though to do ſo, I muſt repeat ſomewhat that I had a former occaſion to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And firſt, this Liquor being Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the plant, and aſſimilated by the ſeveral parts of it, is turn'd into the Wood, Bark, Pith, Leaves, &amp;c. of the Vine; The ſame Liquor may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dry'd, and faſhon'd into Vine-buds, and theſe a while after are advanced unto ſour Grapes, which expreſſ'd yield Verjuice, a Liquor very differing in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral qualities both from Wine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liquors obtainable from the Vine: Theſe ſoure Grapes being by the heat of the Sun concocted and ripened, turne to well taſted Grapes; Thoſe if dry'd in the Sun and Diſtill'd, afford a faetid Oyle and a piercing <hi>Empyreumatical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but not a Vinous Spirit; Theſe dry'd Grapes or Raiſins boyl'd in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proportion of Water make a ſweet Liquor, which being betimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd afford an Oyle and Spirit much like
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:105458:218"/>thoſe of the Raiſins themſelves; If the juice of the Grapes be ſqueez'd out and put to Ferment, it firſt becomes a ſweet and turbid Liquor, then grows leſſe ſweet and more clear, and then affords in common Diſtillations not an Oyle but a Spirit, which, though inflamable like Oyle, differs much from it, in that it is not fat, and that it will readily mingle with Water. I have likewiſe without Addition obtain'd in proceſſe of time (and by an eaſie way which I am ready to teach you) from one of the nobleſt ſorts of Wine, pretty ſtore of pure and curiouſly figured Cryſtals of Salt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a great proportion of a Liquor as ſweet almoſt as Hony; and theſe I obtained not from Muſt, but True and ſprightly Wine; beſides the Vinous Liquor, the fermented Juice of Grapes is partly turned into liquid Dregs or Leeze, and partly into that cruſt or dry feculan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is commonly called Tartar; and this Tartar may by the Fire be eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five differing ſubſtances; four of which are not Acid, and the other not ſo manifeſtly Acid as the Tartar it ſelf; The ſame Vinous Juice after ſome time, eſpecially if it be not carefully
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:105458:218"/>kept, Degenerates into that very ſour Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor called Vinegar; from which you may obtain by the Fire a Spirit and a Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Salt differing enough from the Spirit and Lixiviate Salt of Tartar. And if you pour the Dephlegm'd Spirit of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar upon the Salt of Tartar, there will be produc'd ſuch a Conflict or Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition as if there were ſcarce two more contrary Bodies in Nature; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this Vinager you may obſerve part of the matter to be turned into an innumerable company of ſwimming Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which our Friend having divers years ago obſerved, hath in one of his Papers taught us how to diſcover clearly without the help of a <hi>Microſcope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Into all theſe various Schemes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or differingly Qualifyed Bodies, beſides divers others that I purpoſely forbear to mention, may the Water that is imbib'd by the roots of the Vine be brought, partly by the formative power of the plant, and partly by ſupervenient Agents or Cauſes, without the viſible concurrence of any extraneous Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but if we be allowed to add to the Productions of this tranſmuted Water a ſew other ſubſtances, we may much
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:105458:219"/>encreaſe the Variety of ſuch Bodies; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this ſecond ſort of Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Vinous parts ſeem ſcarce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing of the much more fix'd Bodies wherewith they were mingl'd, but only to have by their Mixture with them acquir'd ſuch a Diſpoſition, that in their receſs occaſion'd by the Fire they came to be alter'd as to ſhape, or Bigneſs, or both, and aſſociated after a New manner. Thus, as I formerly told you, I did by the Addition of a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Antimony, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies unfit for Diſtillation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from crude Tartar, ſtore of a very Volatile and Cryſtalline Salt, differing very much in ſmell and other Qualities from the uſuall ſalts of Tartar.</p>
                  <p>But (ſayes <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> interrupting him at theſe Words) if you have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon you, I would very gladly before you go any further, be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inform'd, how you make this Volatile Salt, becauſe (you know) that ſuch Multitudes of Chymiſts have by a ſcarce imaginable Variety of wayes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in Vain the Volatilization of the Salt of Tartar, that divers learned <hi>Spagyrists</hi> ſpeak as if it were impoſſible,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:105458:219"/>to make any thing out of Tartar, that ſhall be Volatile in a Saline Forme, or as ſome of them expreſs it, <hi>in forma ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> I am very farr from thinking (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Carneades</hi>) that the Salt I have mention'd is that which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> mean when they ſpeak of <hi>Sal Tartari Volatile,</hi> and aſcribe ſuch great things to it. For the Salt I ſpeak of falls extreamly ſhort of thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, not ſeeming in its Taſt, Smel, and other Obvious Qualities, to differ very much (though ſomething it do differ) from Salt of Harts-horn, and other Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts drawn from the Diſtill'd Parts of Animals. Nor have I yet made Tryals enough to be ſure, that it is a pure Salt of Tartar without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating any thing at all of the Nitre, or Antimony. But becauſe it ſeems more likely to proceed from the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, than from any of the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and becauſe the Experiment is in it ſelf not Ignoble, and Luciferous enough (as ſhewing a new way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Volatile Salt contrary to Acid Salts from Bodies that otherwiſe are Obſerv'd to yield no ſuch Liquor, but either only, or chiefly, Acid ones,) I
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:105458:220"/>ſhall, to ſatisfie you, acquaint you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of my other Friends with the way I now uſe (for I have formerly us'd ſome others) to make it.</p>
                  <p>Take then of good Antimony, Salt-Petre and Tartar, of each an equal weight, and of Quicklime Halfe the Weight of any one of them; let theſe be powder'd and well mingl'd; this done, you muſt have in readineſs a long neck or Retort of Earth, which muſt be plac'd in a Furnace for a naked Fire, and have at the top of it a hole of a convenient Bigneſs, at which you may caſt in the Mixture, and preſently ſtop it up again; this Veſſel being fitted with a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver muſt have Fire made under it, till the bottom of the ſides be red hot, and then you muſt caſt in the above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Mixture, by about halfe a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (more or leſs) at a time, at the hole made for that purpoſe; which being nimbly ſtopt, the Fumes will paſs into the Receiver and condenſe there into a Liquor, that being rectifi'd will be of a pure golden Colour, and carry up that colour to a great height; this Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in the Salt I told you of, part of which may eaſily enough be ſeparated
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:105458:220"/>by the way I uſe in ſuch caſes, which is, to put the Liquor into a glaſs Egg, or bolthead with a long and narrow Neck. For if this be plac'd a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in hot ſand, there will ſublime up a fine Salt, which, as I told you, I find to be much of kin to the Volatile Salts of Animals: For like them it has a Saltiſh, not an Acid Salt; it hiſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affuſion of Spirit of Nitre, or Oyle of Vitriol; it precipitates Corals Diſſolv'd in Spirit of Vinager; it turnes the blew Syrup of Violets immediately green; it preſently turnes the Solution of Sublimate into a Milkie whiteneſs; and in ſumm, has divers Operations like thoſe that I have obſerv'd in that ſort of Salts to which I have reſembled it: and is ſo Volatile, that for Diſtinction ſake, I call it <hi>Tartari Fugitivus.</hi> What virtues it may have in Phyſick I have not yet had the opportunity to Try; but I am apt to think they will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable. And beſides that a very Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Friend of mine tells me he hath done great matters againſt the ſtone, with a Preparation not very much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from ours, a very Experienc'd Germane Chymiſt finding that I was
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:105458:221"/>unacquainted with the wayes of making this ſalt, told me that in a great City in his Country, a noted Chymiſt prizes it ſo highly, that he had a while ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd a Priviledge from the Magiſtrates, that none but He, or by his Licence, ſhould vent a Spirit made almoſt after the ſame Way with mine, ſave that he leaves out one of the Ingredients, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Quick-lime. But, continues <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades,</hi> to reſume my Former Diſcourſe where your Curioſity interrupted it;</p>
                  <p>Tis alſo a common practice in <hi>France</hi> to bury thin Plates of Copper in the Marc (as the French call it) or Husks of Grapes, whence the Juice has been ſqueez'd out in the Wine-preſs, and by this means the more ſaline parts of thoſe Husks working by little and little upon the Copper, Coagulate Themſelves with it into that Blewiſh Green Subſtance we in Engliſh call Verdigreaſe. Of which I therefore take Notice, becauſe having Diſtill'd it in a Naked Fire, I found as I expected, that by the Aſſociation of the Saline with the Metalline parts, the former were ſo alter'd, that the Diſtill'd Liquor, even without Rectification, ſeem'd by ſmell
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:105458:221"/>and Taſt, ſtrong almoſt like <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and very much ſurpaſſed the pureſt and moſt Rectifi'd Spirit of Vinager that ever I made. And this Spirit I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſcribe to the ſalt of the Husks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by their Co-Mixture with the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (though the Fire afterwards Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and Tranſmute them) becauſe I found this later in the bottom of the Retort in the Forme of a <hi>Crocus</hi> or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh powder: And becauſe Copper is of too ſluggiſh a Nature to be forc'd over in cloſe Veſſels by no ſtronger a heat. And that which is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Remarkable in the Deſtillation of good Verdigreaſe, (or at leaſt of that ſort that I us'd) is this, that I Never could obſerve that it yielded me any oyl, (unleſs a little black ſlime which was ſeparated in Rectification may paſs for Oyle) though both Tartar and Vinager, (eſpecially the former) will by Deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation yield a Moderate proportion of it. If likewiſe you pour Spirit of Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon Calcin'd Lead, the Acid Salt of the Liquor will by its Commixture with the Metalline parts, though Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, acquire in a few hours a more than Saccharine ſweetneſs; and theſe Saline
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:105458:222"/>parts being by a ſtrong Fire Deſtill'd from the Lead wherewith they were imbody'd, will, as I formerly alſo noted to a Different purpoſe, leave the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal behind them alter'd in ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from what it was, and will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aſcend, partly in the Forme of an unctuous Body or Oyle, partly in that of Phlegme; but for the greateſt part in the Forme of a ſubtile Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd, beſides divers new Qualities which I am not now willing to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, with a ſtrong ſmell very much other than that of Vinager, and a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing taſt quite differing both from the Sowerneſs of the Spirit of Vinager, and the Sweetneſs of the Sugar of Lead.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, As the difference of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may depend meerly upon that of the ſchemes whereinto their Common matter is put; So the ſeeds of Things, the Fire and the other Agents are able to alter the minute parts of a Body (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by breaking them into ſmaller ones of differing ſhapes, or by Uniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe Fragments with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken Corpuſcles, or ſuch Corpuſcles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Themſelves) and the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents partly by Altering the ſhape or
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:105458:222"/>bigneſs of the Conſtituent Corpuſcles of a Body, partly by driving away ſome of them, partly by blending others with them, and partly by ſome new manner of connecting them, may give the whole por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter a new Texture of its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute parts; and thereby make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a new and Diſtinct name. So that according as the ſmall parts of matter recede from each other, or work upon each other, or are connected together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this or that determinate manner, a Body of this or that denomination is produced, as ſome other Body happens thereby to be alter'd or deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>Since then thoſe things which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts produce by the help of the Fire are but inanimate Bodies; ſince ſuch fruits of the Chymiſts skill differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but in ſo few qualities that we ſee plainly that by fire and other Agents we can employ, we can eaſily enough work as great alterations upon matter, as thoſe that are requiſite to change one of theſe Chymical Productions into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Since the ſame portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may without being Compounded with any extraneous Body, or at leaſt Element, be made to put on ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:105458:223"/>of formes, and conſequently to be (ſucceſſively) turn'd into ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Bodies. And ſince the matter cloath'd with ſo many differing formes was originally but water, and that in its paſſage thorow ſo many transformations, it was never reduc'd into any of thoſe ſubſtances which are reputed to be the Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, except by the violence of the fire, which it ſelf divides not Bodies into perfectly ſimple or Elementary ſubſtances, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new Compounds; Since, I ſay, theſe things are ſo, I ſee not why we muſt needs believe that there are any Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal and ſimple Bodies, of which as of Pre-exſiſtent Elements Nature is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to compound all others. Nor do I ſee why we may not conceive that ſhe may produce the Bodies accounted mixt out of one another by Variouſly altering and contriving their minute parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſolving the matter into any ſuch ſimple or Homogeneous ſubſtances as are pretended. Neither, to diſpatch, do I ſee why it ſhould be counted abſur'd to think, that when a Body is reſolv'd by the Fire into its ſuppos'd ſimple Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, thoſe ſubſtances are not true and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:105458:223"/>proper Elements, but rather were, as it were, Accidentally produc'd by the fire, which by Diſſipating a Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minute Parts does, if thoſe parts be ſhut up in Cloſe Veſſels, for the moſt part neceſſarily bring them to Aſſociate Themſelves after another manner than before, and ſo bring Them into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſuch Different Conſiſtences as the Former Texture of the Body, and Concurrent Circumſtances make ſuch disbanded particles apt to Conſtitute; as experience ſhews us (and I have both noted it, and prov'd it already) that as there are ſome Concretes whoſe parts when diſſipated by fire are fitted to be put into ſuch Schemes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as we call Oyle, and Salt, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; So there are others, ſuch as are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the greateſt part of Minerals, whoſe Corpuſcles being of another Size or figure, or perhaps contriv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Way, will not in the Fire yield Bodies of the like Conſiſtences, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther others of differing Textures; Not to mention, that from Gold and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies, we ſee not that the Fire ſeparates any Diſtinct Subſtances at all; nor That even thoſe Similar Parts of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:105458:224"/>Bodies which the Chymiſts Obtain by the Fire, are the Elements whoſe names they bear, but Compound Bodies, upon which, for their reſemblance to them in conſiſtence, or ſome other obvious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Chymiſts have been pleas'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch Appellations.</p>

                  <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>THeſe laſt Words of <hi>Carneades</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after follow'd by a noiſe which ſeem'd to come from the place where the reſt of the Company was, he took it for a warning, that it was time for him to conclude or break off his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; and told his Friend; By this time I hope you ſee, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> that if <hi>Helmonts</hi> Experiments be true, it is no abſurdity to queſtion whether that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be one, that doth not aſſert Any Elements in the ſence before explain'd. But becauſe that, as divers of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſuppoſe the marvellous power of the <hi>Alkahest</hi> in the Analyzing of Bodies, ſo the Effects aſcrib'd to that power are ſo unparallell'd and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:105458:225"/>that though I am not ſure but that there <hi>may be</hi> ſuch an Agent, yet little leſs than <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> ſeems requiſite to make a man ſure there <hi>is.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I leave it to you to judge, how farre thoſe of my Arguments that are built upon <hi>Alkahestical</hi> Operations are weakned by that Liquors being Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and ſhall therefore deſire you not to think that I propoſe this Paradox that rejects all Elements, as an Opinion equally probable with the former part of my diſcourſe. For by that, I hope, you are ſatisfied, that the Arguments wont to be brought by Chymiſts, to prove That all Bodies conſiſt of either Three Principles, or Five, are far from being ſo ſtrong as thoſe that I have employ'd to prove, that there is not any certain and Determinate number of ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Elements to be met with Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in all mixt Bodies. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I need not tell you, that theſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chymical</hi> Paradoxes might have been manag'd more to their Advantage; but that having not confin'd my Curioſity to Chymical Experiments, I who am but a young Man, and younger Chymiſt, can yet be but ſlenderly furniſhed with
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:105458:225"/>them, in reference to ſo great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a Task as you impos'd upon me; Beſides that, to tell you the Truth, I durſt not employ ſome even of the beſt Experiments I am acquainted with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I muſt not yet diſcloſe them; but however, I think I may preſume that what I have hitherto Diſcourſed will induce you to think, that Chymiſts have been much more happy in finding Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments than the Cauſes of them; or in aſſigning the Principles by which they may beſt be explain'd. And indeed, when in the writings of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> I meet with ſuch Phantaſtick and Un-intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Diſcourſes as that Writer often puzzels and tyres his Reader with, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon ſuch excellent Experiments, as though he ſeldom clearly teaches, I often find he knew; me thinks the Chymiſts, in their ſearches after truth, are not unlike the Navigators of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Tarſhiſh</hi> Fleet, who brought home from their long and tedious Voyages, not only Gold, and Silver, and Ivory, but Apes and Peacocks too; For ſo the Writings of ſeveral (for I ſay not, all) of your Hermetick Philoſophers preſent us, together with divers Subſtantial and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:105458:226"/>noble Experiments, Theories, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Peacocks feathers make a great ſhew, but are neither ſolid nor uſeful; or elſe like Apes, if they have ſome appearance of being rational, are blemiſh'd with ſome abſurdity or other, that when they are <hi>Attentively</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, makes them appear Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carneades</hi> having thus finiſh'd his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe againſt the received Doctrines of the <hi>Elements; Eleutherius</hi> judging he ſhould not have time to ſay much to him before their ſeparation, made ſome haſte to tell him; I confeſs, <hi>Carneades,</hi> that you have ſaid more in favour of your Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes then I expected. For though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Experiments you have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd are no ſecrets, and were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, yet beſides that you have added many of your own unto them, you have laid them together in ſuch a way, and apply'd them to ſuch purpoſes, and made ſuch Deductions From them, as I have not Hitherto met with.</p>
                  <p>But though I be therefore inclin'd to think, that <hi>Philoponus,</hi> had he heard you, would ſcarce have been able in all
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:105458:226"/>points to defend the Chymical <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> againſt the arguments wherewith you have oppos'd it; yet me thinks that however your Objections ſeem to evince a great part of what they pretend to, yet they evince it not all; and the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tryals of thoſe you call the vulgar Chymiſts, may be allow'd to prove ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if it be granted you that you have made it probable,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the differing ſubſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which mixt Bodies are wont to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Fire are not of a pure and an Elementary nature, eſpecially for this Reaſon, that they yet retain ſo much of the nature of the Concrete that afforded them, as to appear to be yet ſomewhat compounded, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to differ in one Concrete from Principles of the ſame denomination in another:</p>
                  <p>Next, that as to the number of theſe differing ſubſtances, neither is it preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three, becauſe in moſt Vegetable and Animal bodies Earth and Phlegme are alſo to be found among their Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients; nor is there any one determinate number into which the Fire (as it is
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:105458:227"/>wont to be employ'd) does preciſely and univerſally reſolve all compound Bodies whatſoever, as well Minerals as others that are reputed perfectly mixt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that there are divers Qualities which cannot well be refer'd to any of theſe Subſtances, as if they primarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in it and belong'd to it; and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualities, which though they ſeem to have their chief and moſt ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in ſome one of theſe Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, are not yet ſo deducible from it, but that alſo ſome more general Principles muſt be taken in to explicate them.</p>
                  <p>If, I ſay, the Chymiſts (continues <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>) be ſo Liberall as to make you theſe three Conceſſions, I hope you will, on your part, be ſo civil and Equitable as to grant them theſe three other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, namely;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that divers Mineral Bodies, and therefore probably all the reſt, may be reſolv'd into a Saline, a Sulphureous, and a Mercurial part; And that almoſt all Vegetable and Animal Concretes may, if not by the Fire alone, yet, by a skilfull Artiſt Employing the Fire as
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:105458:227"/>his chief Inſtrument, be divided into five differing Subſtances, Salt, Spirit, Oyle, Phlegme and Earth; of which the three former by reaſon of their being ſo much more Operative than the Two Later, deſerve to be Lookt upon as the Three active Principles, and by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be call'd the three principles of mixt bodies.</p>
                  <p>Next, that theſe Principles, Though they be not perfectly Devoid of all Mixture, yet may without inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be ſtil'd the Elements of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodies, and bear the Names of thoſe Subſtances which they moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and which are manifeſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in them; and that eſpecially for this reaſon, that none of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements is Diviſible by the Fire into Four or Five differing ſubſtances, like the Concrete whence it was ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That Divers of the Qualities of a mixt Body, and eſpecially the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Virtues, do for the moſt part lodge in ſome One or Other of its principles, and may Therefore uſefully be ſought for in That Principle ſever'd from the others.</p>
                  <p>And in this alſo (purſues <hi>Eleutherius</hi>)
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:105458:228"/>methinks both you and the Chymiſts may eaſily agree, that the ſureſt way is to Learn by particular Experiments, what differing parts particular Bodies do conſiſt of, and by what wayes (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Actual or potential fire) they may beſt and moſt Conveniently be Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as without relying too much upon the Fire alone, for the reſolving of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo without fruitleſsly contending to force them into more Elements than Nature made Them up of, or ſtrip the ſever'd Principles ſo naked, as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Them Exquiſitely Elementary to make them almoſt uſeleſs,</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (ſubjoynes <hi>Eleu.)</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without deſpairing to ſee them granted by you; not only becauſe I know that you ſo much preferr the Reputation of <hi>Candor</hi> before that of ſubtility, that your having once ſuppos'd a truth would not hinder you from imbracing it when clearly made out to you; but becauſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent occaſion, it will be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement to you to recede from ſome of your Paradoxes, ſince the nature and occaſion of your paſt Diſcourſe did not oblige you to declare your own opinions, but only to perſonate an Antagoniſt of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:105458:228"/>the Chymiſts. So that (concludes he, with a ſmile) you may now by granting what I propoſe, add the Reputation of Loving the truth ſincerely to that of having been able to oppoſe it ſubtilly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carneades</hi>'s haſte forbidding him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this crafty piece of flattery; Till I ſhal (ſayes he) have an opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with my own Opinions about the controverſies I have been diſcourſing of, you will not, I hope, expect I ſhould declare my own ſence of the Arguments I have employ'd. Wherefore I ſhall only tell you thus much at preſent; that though not only an acute Naturaliſt, but even I my ſelf could take plauſible Exceptions at ſome of them; yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them too are ſuch as will not perhaps be readily anſwer'd, and will Reduce my Adverſaries, at leaſt, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Reform their <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> I perceive I need not minde you that the Objections I made againſt the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary of Elements and Ternary of Principles needed not to be oppos'd ſo much againſt the Doctrines Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (either of which, eſpecially the latter, may be much more probably maintain'd than hitherto it ſeems to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:105458:229"/>have been, by thoſe Writers for it I have met with) as againſt the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateneſs and the unconcludingneſs of the <hi>Analytical</hi> Experiments vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Relyed On to Demonſtrate them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if either of the two examin'd Opinions, or any other The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of Elements, ſhall upon rational and Experimental grounds be clearly made out to me; 'Tis Obliging, but not irrational, in you to Expect, that I ſhall not be ſo farr in Love with my Diſquieting Doubts, as not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to change them for undoubted truths. And (concludes <hi>Carneades</hi> ſmiling) it were no great diſparagement for a Sceptick to confeſſe to you, that as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfy'd as the paſt diſcourſe may have made you think me with the Doctrines of the Peripateticks, and the Chymiſts, about the Elements and Principles, I can yet ſo little diſcover what to acquieſce in, that perchance the Enquiries of others have ſcarce been more unſatisfactory to me, than my own have been to my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>And on this occaſion I cannot but take notice, that whereas the great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Chymiſts are wont to employ to vilify Earth and Water, and make them be look'd upon as uſeleſs and unworthy to be reckon'd among the Principles of Mixt Bodies, is, that they are not endow'd with Specifick Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but only with Elementary qualities; of which they uſe to ſpeak very ſleightingly, as of qualities contemptible and unactive: I ſee no ſufficient Reaſon for this Practice of the Chymiſts: For 'tis confeſs'd that Heat is an Elementary Quality, and yet that an almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of confiderable Things are perform'd by Heat, is manifeſt to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:105458:230"/>them that duly conſider the various <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> wherein it intervenes as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Actor; and none ought leſs to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore or diſtruſt this Truth then a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. Since almoſt all the operations and Productions of his Art are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly by the means of Heat. And as for Cold it ſelf, upon whoſe account they ſo deſpiſe the Earth and Water, if they pleaſe to read in the Voyages of our Engliſh and Dutch Navigators in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> and other Northern Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what ſtupendious Things may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Cold, they would not perhaps think it ſo deſpicable. And not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I lately recited to You out of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf, who by the help of an intenſe Cold teaches to ſeparate the Quinteſſence of Wine; I will only now obſerve to You, that the Conſervation of the Texture of many Bodies both ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and inanimate do's ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the convenient motion both of their own Fluid and Looſer Parts, and of the ambient Bodies, whether Air, Water, &amp;c. that not only in humane Bodies we ſee that the immoderate or unſeaſonable coldneſs of the Air (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it finds ſuch Bodies everhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:105458:231"/>do's very frequently diſcompoſe the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of them, and occaſion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Diſeaſes; but in the ſolid and durable Body of Iron it ſelf, in which one would not expect that ſuddain Cold ſhould produce any notable change, it may have ſo great an operation, that if you take a Wire, or other ſlender piece of ſteel, and having brought it in the fire to a white heat, You ſuffer it afterwards to cool leaſurely in the Air, it will when it is cold be much of the ſame hardneſſe it was of before: Whereas if as ſoon as You remove it from the fire, you plunge it into cold water, it will upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Refrigeration acquire a very much greater hardneſs then it had before; Nay, and will become manifeſtly brittle. And that you may not impute this to any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Quality in the Water, or other Liquor, or Unctuous matter, wherein ſuch heated ſteel is wont to be quenched that it may be temper'd; I know a very skillful Tradeſman, that divers times hardens ſteel by ſuddenly cooling it in a Body that is neither a liquor, nor ſo much as moiſt. A tryal of that Nature I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have ſeen made. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by the operation that Water has
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:105458:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon ſteel quenched in it, whether upon the Account of its coldneſs and moiſture, or upon that of any other of its qualities, it appears, that water is not alwaies ſo inefficacious and contemptible a Body, as our Chymiſts would have it paſſe for. And what I have ſaid of the Efficacy of Cold and Heat, might perhaps be eaſily enough carried further by other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and experiments; were it not that having been mention'd only upon the Bye, I muſt not inſiſt on it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another Subject.</p>
